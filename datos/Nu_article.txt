BTI - Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19
LID - 10.3768/rtipress.2021.rr.0045.2106 [doi]
AB  - This study leveraged existing data infrastructure and relationships from the Feedthe Future Senegal Naatal Mbay ("flourishing agriculture") project, funded by theUS Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by RTIInternational from 2015 to 2019. The research informed and empowered farmerorganizations to track and respond to rural households in 2020 as they faced the COVID-19 pandemic. Farmer organizations, with support from RTI and local ICT firmSTATINFO, administered a survey to a sample of 800 agricultural households thatare members of four former Naatal Mbay-supported farmer organizations in tworounds in August and October 2020. Focus group discussions were conducted withnetwork leadership pre- and post-data collection to contextualize the experience of the COVID-19 shock and to validate findings. The results showed that farmerswere already reacting to the effects of low rainfall during the 2019 growingseason and that COVID-19 compounded the shock through disrupted communicationsand interregional travel bans, creating food shortages and pressure to divertseed stocks for food. Food insecurity effects, measured through the HouseholdFood Insecurity Access Scale and cereals stocks, were found to be greater forhouseholds in the Casamance region than in the Kaolack and Kaffrine regions. The findings also indicate that farmer networks deployed a coordinated responsecomprising food aid and access to personal protective equipment, distribution of short-cycle legumes and grains (e.g., cowpea, maize) and vegetable seeds,protection measures for cereals seeds, and financial innovations with banks.However, food stocks were expected to recover as harvesting began in October2020, and the networks were planning to accelerate seed multiplication, diversifycrops beyond cereals, improve communication across the network. and mainstreamaccess to financial instruments in the 2021 growing season. The researchindicated that the previous USAID-funded project had likely contributed to thenetworks' COVID-19 resilience capacities by building social capital and fosteringthe new use of tools and technologies over the years it operated.

TI  - Working from home during COVID-19 in a Danish hospital research setting:experiences of researchers and healthcare providers, explored by Group ConceptMapping.
PG  - e063279
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063279 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the working environment, how wethink of it and how it stands to develop into the future. Knowledge about howpeople have continued to work on-site and adjusted to working from home duringthe COVID-19 lockdown will be vital for planning work arrangements in thepost-pandemic period. Our primary objective was to investigate experiences ofworking from home or having colleagues working from home during a late stage ofthe COVID-19 lockdown among researchers and healthcare providers in a hospitalresearch setting. Second, we aimed to investigate researchers' productivitythrough changes in various proxy measures during lockdown as compared withpre-lockdown. DESIGN: Mixed-method participatory Group Concept Mapping (GCM).SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: GCM, based on a mixed-method participatory approach,was applied involving researchers' and healthcare providers' online sorting andrating experiences working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. At aface-to-face meeting, participants achieved consensus on the number and labellingof domains-the basis for developing a conceptual model. RESULTS: Through the GCM approach, 47 participants generated 125 unique statements of experiences related to working from home, which were organised into seven clusters. Using theseclusters, we developed a conceptual model that illustrated the pros and cons ofworking from home. CONCLUSION: The future work setting, the role of the officeand the overall work environment need to respond to workers' increased wish forflexible work arrangements and co-decision.

TI  - Effects of remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown on children's visualhealth: a systematic review.
PG  - e062388
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062388 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increased exposure to digital devices as part of online classesincreases susceptibility to visual impairments, particularly among schoolstudents taught using e-learning strategies. This study aimed to identify theimpact of remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown on children's visualhealth. DESIGN: Systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items forSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. DATA SOURCES: Scopus, PubMed andScienceDirect databases from the year 2020 onwards. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Weincluded cross-sectional, case-control, cohort studies, case series and casereports, published in English, Spanish or French, that approached the effects of remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown on visual health in neurotypicalchildren. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We included a total of 21 articles with previous quality assessments using the Joanna Briggs checklist. Risk of biasassessment was applied using the National Institutes of Health quality assessmenttool for before-and-after studies with no control group; the tool developed byHoy et al to assess cross-sectional studies; the Murad et al tool to evaluate themethodological quality of case reports and case series; and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. RESULTS: All but one study reported a deleteriousimpact of the COVID-19 lockdown on visual health in children. Overall, the mostfrequently identified ocular effects were refractive errors, accommodationdisturbances and visual symptoms such as dry eye and asthenopia. CONCLUSIONS:Increased dependence on digital devices for online classes has either induced or exacerbated visual disturbances, such as rapid progression of myopia, dry eye andvisual fatigue symptoms, and vergence and accommodation disturbances, in childrenwho engaged in remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown.

TI  - Development and validation of an early warning score to identify COVID-19 in the emergency department based on routine laboratory tests: a multicentrecase-control study.
PG  - e059111
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Identifying patients with a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection in theemergency department (ED) is challenging. Symptoms differ, incidence rates varyand test capacity may be limited. As PCR-testing all ED patients is neitherfeasible nor effective in most centres, a rapid, objective, low-cost earlywarning score to triage ED patients for a possible infection is developed.DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Secondary and tertiary hospitals in theNetherlands. PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients presenting to the ED with venous blood sampling from July 2019 to July 2020 (n=10 417, 279SARS-CoV-2-positive). The temporal validation cohort covered the period from July2020 to October 2021 (n=14 080, 1093 SARS-CoV-2-positive). The externalvalidation cohort consisted of patients presenting to the ED of three hospitalsin the Netherlands (n=12 061, 652 SARS-CoV-2-positive). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES:The primary outcome was one or more positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results within 1day prior to or 1 week after ED presentation. RESULTS: The resulting'CoLab-score' consists of 10 routine laboratory measurements and age. The scoreshowed good discriminative ability (AUC: 0.930, 95% CI 0.909 to 0.945). Thelowest CoLab-score had high sensitivity for COVID-19 (0.984, 95% CI 0.970 to0.991; specificity: 0.411, 95% CI 0.285 to 0.520). Conversely, the highest score had high specificity (0.978, 95% CI 0.973 to 0.983; sensitivity: 0.608, 95% CI0.522 to 0.685). The results were confirmed in temporal and external validation. CONCLUSIONS: The CoLab-score is based on routine laboratory measurements and isavailable within 1 hour after presentation. Depending on the prevalence, COVID-19may be safely ruled out in over one-third of ED presentations. Highly suspectcases can be identified regardless of presenting symptoms. The CoLab-score iscontinuous, in contrast to the binary outcome of lateral flow testing, and canguide PCR testing and triage ED patients.

LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063935 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of messenger RNA (mRNA) booster dosesduring the period of Delta and Omicron variant dominance. DESIGN: We conducted a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate the vaccine effectiveness(VE) of three and two doses of mRNA vaccines against infection (regardless ofsymptoms) and against COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death. SETTING:Veterans Health Administration. PARTICIPANTS: We used electronic health recorddata from 114 640 veterans who had a SARS-CoV-2 test during November 2021-January2022. Patients were largely 65 years or older (52%), male (88%) and non-Hispanic white (59%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First positive result for a SARS-CoV-2 PCR orantigen test. RESULTS: Against infection, booster doses had higher estimated VE(64%, 95% CI 63 to 65) than two-dose vaccination (12%, 95% CI 10 to 15) duringthe Omicron period. For the Delta period, the VE against infection was 90% (95%CI 88 to 92) among boosted vaccinees, higher than the VE among two-dose vaccinees(54%, 95% CI 50 to 57). Against hospitalisation, booster dose VE was 89% (95% CI 88 to 91) during Omicron and 94% (95% CI 90 to 96) during Delta; two-dose VE was 63% (95% CI 58 to 67) during Omicron and 75% (95% CI 69 to 80) during Delta.Against death, the VE with a booster dose was 94% (95% CI 90 to 96) duringOmicron and 96% (95% CI 87 to 99) during Delta. CONCLUSIONS: Among an older,mostly male, population with comorbidities, we found that an mRNA vaccine boosterwas highly effective against infection, hospitalisation and death. Although theeffectiveness of booster vaccination against infection was moderately higheragainst Delta than against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant, effectiveness against severe disease and death was similarly high against both variants.

LID - 10.4187/respcare.10094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed high rates of burnout among respiratory therapists (RTs), which has implications for patient care and outcomes as well asfor the health care workforce. We sought to better understand RT well-beingduring the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine ratesand identify determinants of well-being, including burnout and professionalfulfillment, among RTs in ICUs. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods studycomprised of a survey administered quarterly from July 2020-May 2021 tocritical-care health care professionals and semi-structured interviews fromApril-May 2021 with 10 ICU RTs within a single health center. We performedmultivariable analyses to compare RT well-being to other professional groups and to evaluate changes in well-being over time. We analyzed qualitative interviewdata using thematic analysis, followed by mapping themes to the Maslow needshierarchy. RESULTS: One hundred and eight RTs responded to at least one quarterlysurvey. Eighty-two (75%) experienced burnout; 39 (36%) experienced professionalfulfillment, and 62 (58%) reported symptoms of depression. Compared to cliniciansof other professions in multivariable analyses, RTs were significantly morelikely to experience burnout (odds ratio 2.32 [95% CI 1.41-3.81]) and depression (odds ratio 2.73 [95% CI 1.65-4.51]) and less likely to experience fulfillment(odds ratio 0.51 [95% CI 0.31-0.85]). We found that staffing challenges, safetyconcerns, workplace conflict, and lack of work-life balance led to burnout.Patient care, use of specialized skills, appreciation and a sense of community atwork, and purpose fostered professional fulfillment. Themes identified weremapped to Maslow's hierarchy of needs; met needs led to professional fulfillment,and unmet needs led to burnout. CONCLUSIONS: ICU RTs experienced burnout duringthe pandemic at rates higher than other professions. To address RT needs,institutions should design and implement strategies to reduce burnout across all levels.

LID - 10.4187/respcare.10144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burnout is a major challenge in health care and is associated withpoor overall well-being, increased medical errors, worse patient outcomes, andlow job satisfaction. There is scant literature focused on the respiratorytherapist's (RT) experience of burnout, and a thorough exploration of RTs'perception of factors associated with burnout has not been reported. The aim ofthis qualitative study was to understand the factors associated with burnout asexperienced by RTs amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a post hoc, qualitative analysis of free-text responses from a survey of burnout prevalencein RTs. RESULTS: There were 1,114 total and 220 free-text responses. Fiveoverarching themes emerged from the analysis: staffing, workload,physical/emotional consequences, lack of effective leadership, and lack ofrespect. Respondents discussed feelings of anxiety, depression, and compassionfatigue as well as concerns that lack of adequate staffing, high workloadassignments, and inadequate support from leadership contributed to feelings ofburnout. Specific instances of higher patient acuity, surge in critically illpatients, rapidly evolving changes in treatment recommendations, and minimaltraining and preparation for an extended scope of practice were reported asstressors that led to burnout. Some respondents stated that they felt a lack ofrespect for both the RT profession and the contribution of RTs to patient care.CONCLUSIONS: Themes associated with burnout in RTs included staffing, workload,physical and emotional exhaustion, lack of effective leadership, and lack ofrespect. These results provide potential targets for interventions to combatburnout among RTs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the COVID-19pandemic and the instructional changes implemented in response to it affectedstudent enrollment, retention, or success on the National Board for RespiratoryCare credentialing examinations at an associate degree respiratory care programin the state of Texas. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of student enrollment,retention data, and graduate success rates on the National Board for Respiratory Care credentialing examinations were used in this study. The data were collected from an associate degree respiratory care program in Texas and included 69graduates for the 5-year study period. The 3 academic years that led up to theCOVID-19 pandemic served as a "pre-pandemic" baseline for comparison. The cohort of 2019-2020 was labeled "early pandemic," the cohort of 2020-2021 was labeled"mid pandemic," and the cohort of 2021-2022 was labeled "late pandemic" for data comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and theMann-Whitney U test were used for data analysis (P < .05). RESULTS: The number ofprogram applicants significantly decreased between the pre- and late-pandemicgroups (P = .001), but overall student enrollment (P = .42) and retention (P =.95) were not significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first-timepass rate on the Therapist Multiple-Choice examination low-cut score (P = .005)and high-cut score (P = .007) were significantly reduced in the mid-pandemicgroup when compared with the previous cohorts. There were no statisticallysignificant differences in the demographic data or online questionnaire responsesfrom the early- and mid-pandemic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic andthe instructional changes implemented in response to it decreased students'first-time pass rate on the Therapist Multiple-Choice examination in themid-pandemic group compared with the pre- and early-pandemic groups.

LID - 10.1111/ijn.13084 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictors of burnout in femalenurses during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also sought to evaluatethe relationship between each of the variables studied (anxiety, depression,sociodemographic and COVID-19 variables) and the dimensions of the burnout.BACKGROUND: One of the groups of health care workers worst affected by theCOVID-19 crisis has been women working as nursing staff, due to the highpercentage they account for at a global level and their direct contact withinfected patients. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional, quantitative study.METHODS: Four hundred forty-four Spanish female nurses from hospital and primary health care centres took part in the study. The data were obtained in 2020 bymeans of an online survey. RESULTS: Symptoms of depression are a common predictorvariable to all the dimensions of burnout, whereas symptoms of anxiety predictemotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Age and years of experience in thejob predict depersonalization, whereas the probability of contracting theinfection is a predictor variable of emotional exhaustion and personalaccomplishment. CONCLUSION: Predictor variables should be considered in thecreation of prevention and intervention plans to reduce the levels of burnout in female nurses.

PG  - 155-158
LID - 10.1089/ped.2020.1214 [doi]
AB  - Background: Biologics are the cornerstone of therapy in children and adolescents with severe or uncontrolled allergic diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis,and chronic urticaria. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection a pandemic inMarch 2020, some scientific societies have released statements on the use ofbiologics in allergic children and adolescents. Materials and Methods: Given the very limited data in Italy on use of biological therapies in allergic childrenand adolescents during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, amulticenter observational nationwide survey was conducted to collect thisinformation. The 11-question survey was designed to determine (1) the number ofallergic children and adolescents treated with omalizumab, mepolizumab, ordupilumab for asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic urticaria; (2) the number ofthese patients who developed COVID-19; and (3) severity of COVID-19 symptoms.Twenty pediatric centers participated, and data were collected from February toApril 2020. Results: Three hundred eight children and adolescents (mean age 12.8 years, 161 males) were treated with biologics. Only 3 subjects (1%) who had been treated with omalizumab experienced paucisymptomatic COVID-19, but those symptomspromptly resolved. Of the 9 patients treated with mepolizumab, none had COVID-19 or asthma exacerbations. Of the 6 asthmatic subjects and 7 patients with chronic urticaria treated with dupilumab, none had COVID-19. Also, there was no worseningof the underlying disease. Conclusion: These very preliminary outcomes suggestthat continuing biologics seem to be safe. Therefore, biologics could becontinued in patients with severe allergic diseases, but withheld once contractedCOVID-19.

AB  - Older adults in nursing homes are at greatest risk of morbidity and mortalityfrom SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nursing home residents constituted one-third to morethan half of all deaths during the early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.Following this, widespread adaptation of infection prevention and controlmeasures and the supply and use of personal protective equipment resulted in asignificant decrease in nursing home infections and deaths. For nursing homes,the most important determinant of experiencing a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the firstinstance appears to be community-transmission levels (particularly with variants of concern), although nursing home size and quality, for-profit status, andsociodemographic characteristics are also important. Use of visitation bans,imposed to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on residents, must be delicatelybalanced against their impact on resident, friend or family, and staffwell-being. The successful rollout of primary vaccination has resulted in a sharpdecrease in morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes. However,emerging evidence suggests that vaccine efficacy may wane over time, and the use of a third or additional vaccine "booster" doses in nursing home residentsrestores protection afforded by primary vaccination. Ongoing monitoring ofvaccine efficacy in terms of infection, morbidity, and mortality is crucial inthis vulnerable group in informing ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boostingstrategies. Here, we detail the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on nursing home residentsand discuss important considerations in the management of nursing home SARS-CoV-2outbreaks. We additionally examine the use of testing strategies,nonpharmacologic outbreak control measures and vaccination strategies in thiscohort. Finally, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the sector is reflected on as weemphasize the need for adoption of universal standards of medical care andintegration with wider public health infrastructure in nursing homes in order to provide a safe and effective long-term care sector.

TI  - Coronaviruses exploit a host cysteine-aspartic protease for replication.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05148-4 [doi]
AB  - Highly pathogenic coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(1,2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV)(3), and SARS-CoV-1(4) vary in their transmissibility andpathogenicity. However, infection by all three viruses results in substantialapoptosis in cell culture(5-7) and in patient tissues(8-10), suggesting apotential link between apoptosis and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Here we show that a cysteine-aspartic protease of the apoptosis cascade, caspase-6, serves as an important host factor for efficient coronavirus replication. We demonstratethat caspase-6 cleaves coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins, generating Nfragments that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists, thus facilitating virusreplication. Inhibition of caspase-6 substantially attenuates lung pathology and body weight loss of SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian hamsters and improves thesurvival of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoVMA)-infected human DPP4 knock-in(hDPP4 KI) mice. Overall, our study reveals how coronaviruses exploit a componentof the host apoptosis cascade to facilitate virus replication.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A limited number of studies have shown a decline in antibody titersin healthcare workers beyond six months after the second dose of the BNT162b2vaccine, and has been insufficiently investigated yet in the respective Asianethnic groups. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study on 187healthcare workers and other personnel and healthy adults at least eight monthsafter vaccination at the International University of Health and Welfare. RESULTS:The baseline (before the third dose of BNT162b2) anti-receptor binding domain(RBD) IgG level was 569[377-943] AU/mL 245[240-250] days after the second dose.The mean antibody titer of participants aged 20-29 years was 4.6 times higherthan that of participants aged 70-79 years. After booster vaccination, serumanti-RBD antibody levels were elevated in all participants with a median titer of23,250[14,612-33,401] AU/mL 21[19-23] days after the third dose. The medianpost-booster antibody titers in the 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 years age groups were 30.6, 33.0, 33.8, 27.4, 50.1, and 90.3 times, respectively,higher than the pre-booster ones. Antibody levels were 15% lower in dailydrinkers compared to nondrinkers, suggesting that daily alcohol consumption canprevent antibody levels from increasing after vaccination. Our results showdecreased antibody titers after two doses of the vaccine, especially in theelderly; however, the third dose of the vaccine resulted in a significantincrease in antibody titers in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: We providedinformation on antibody responses following primary and booster doses of theBNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in Japan.

AB  - The pulmonary pathological findings associated with severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) result from the release of multipleproinflammatory cytokines, which causes the subsequential damage of the lungs.The current study was undertaken to investigate the responses of mast cells toviral inoculation and their contribution to host defenses from the point of view of viral entry. Pseudovirions, in which the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was incorporated, triggered activation of mast cells, and a mast cell-derivedchymase, MCP2, formed a complex with spike protein, which promotedprotease-dependent viral entry. According to the quantification results of viral entry, 10muM quercetin, a mast cell stabilizer, potentially potently inhibited41.3% of viral entry, while 100muM chymostatin, which served as a chymaseinhibitor, suppressed 52.1% of viral entry, compared to non-treated cells. Study using mast cell-deficient mice showed that the absence of mast cells mayinfluence early viral loading in the upper respiratory tract, which consequently increases the risk of viral invasion into the lower respiratory system.Furthermore, mast cell-deficient mice exhibited ongoing infection in the latephase post-viral inoculation, while clearance of virus-positive cells wasobserved in wild-type mice. In conclusion, mast cells act as a multifacetedimmune modulator that is equipped with both protective effects and pathogenicinfluences on viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. The utility of mast cell stabilizers andchymase inhibitors in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratorysyndrome should be optimized regarding the infection stage and the risk ofcytokine storm.

AB  - We compared the clinical course of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) before and after the emergence of the omicron variant and based onvaccination status. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical charts of 224 patients and 82 deliveries from November 1, 2020, to March 7, 2022; of these,42% were diagnosed during the omicron dominance period. Disease severity andmorbidity of COVID-19 were significantly decreased during the omicron era. Thevaccination rates among the patients were higher after omicron emergence (31.9%) than before (6.9%). Overall, 4.1% and 25% of patients had severe symptoms, and2.6% and 16.2% required oxygen therapy in the vaccination and non-vaccinationgroups, respectively. Overall, patients had a more favorable clinical course inthe omicron era; moreover, vaccinated patients were better protected thannon-vaccinated patients, indicating the importance of vaccination againstCOVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasound (LUS) is useful to diagnose and assess the severityof pulmonary lesions during CoViD-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (CoARDS). A conventional LUS score is proposed to measure the loss of aerationduring CoARDS. However, this score was validated during the pre-COVID-19 era inARDS patients in intensive care and does not consider the differences withCoARDS. An alternative LUS method is based on grading the percentage of extensionof the typical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia on the lung surface (LUSext). RESEARCHQUESTION: Is LUSext feasible in COVID-19 patients at onset of disease and does itcorrelate with the volumetric measure of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia lesionsat computed tomography (CTvol)? STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: This observational studyenrolled a convenience sampling of patients in the emergency department withconfirmed COVID-19 and demonstration of pneumonia at bedside LUS and CT scan.LUSext was visually quantified. All CT studies were retrospectively analyzed by aspecifically designed software to calculate the CTvol. The correlation betweenLUSext and CTvol, and the correlations of each score with PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F)were calculated. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 179 patients. Feasibility ofLUSext was 100%. Time to perform LUS scan was 5 + 1.5 mins. LUSext and CTvol werepositively correlated, with R = 0.67, P < 0.0001. Both LUSext and CTvol showednegative correlation with P/F, respectively with R = -0.66 and R = -0.54; P<0.0001. INTERPRETATION: LUSext is a valid measure of the severity of the lesionswhen compared to CT scan. Not only are LUSext and CTvol correlated, but they alsohave similar inverse correlation with the severity of respiratory failure. LUSextis a practical and simple bedside measure of the severity of pneumonia in CoARDS,whose clinical and prognostic impact need to be further investigated.

AB  - The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses mediates host cell entry and is S-acylated on multiple phylogenetically conserved cysteine residues.Multiple protein acyltransferase enzymes have been reported topost-translationally modify Spike proteins; however, strategies to exploit thismodification are currently lacking. Using resin-assisted capture massspectrometry, we demonstrate here the Spike protein is S-acylated inSARS-CoV-2-infected human and monkey cells. We further show increased abundanceof the human acyltransferase ZDHHC5 associates with increased S-acylation of the Spike protein, whereas ZDHHC5 knockout cells had a 40% reduction in theincorporation of an alkynyl-palmitate using click chemistry detection. We alsofind the S-acylation of the Spike protein is not limited to palmitate, asclickable versions of myristate and stearate were also found on theimmunocaptured protein. Yet, we observed ZDHHC5 was only modified when incubated with alkyne-palmitate, suggesting it has specificity for this acyl-CoA, and that other ZDHHC enzymes may use additional fatty acids to modify the Spike protein.Since multiple ZDHHC isoforms may modify the Spike protein, we also examined the ability of the fatty acid synthase inhibitor TVB-3166 to prevent S-acylation ofthe Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and human CoV-229E. We show treating cells with TVB-3166 inhibited S-acylation of ectopically expressed Spike and attenuated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and human CoV-229E to spread in vitro. Our findings furthersubstantiate the necessity of CoV Spike protein S-acylation and demonstrate that de novo fatty acid synthesis is critical for the proper S-acylation of the Spike protein.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prior research identified a significant decline in the number ofabortions in Louisiana at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well asincreases in second-trimester abortions and decreases in medication abortions.This study examines how service disruptions in particular areas of the statedisparately affected access to abortion care based on geography. STUDY DESIGN: Wecollected monthly service data from Louisiana's abortion clinics (January2018-May 2020) and conducted mystery client calls to determine whether clinicswere scheduling appointments at pandemic onset (April-May 2020). We usedsegmented regression to assess whether service disruptions modified the mainpandemic effects on the number, timing and type of abortions using stratifiedmodels and interaction terms. Additionally, we calculated the median distancethat Louisiana residents traveled to the clinic where they obtained care.RESULTS: For residents whose closest clinic was consistently schedulingappointments at the onset of the pandemic, the number of monthly abortions didnot change [IRR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.84-1.36]. For those whose closest clinic serviceswere disrupted, the number of monthly abortions decreased by 46% [IRR=0.54, 95%CI: 0.45-0.65]. Similarly, increases in second-trimester abortions and decreases in medication abortions were concentrated in areas where residents experiencedservice disruptions [AOR=2.25, 95% CI: 1.21-4.56 and AOR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.29-0.87,respectively] and were not seen elsewhere in the state. CONCLUSION: Changes inthe number, timing and type of abortions were concentrated among residents inparticular areas of Louisiana. The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemicexacerbated geographic disparities in access to abortion care.

AB  - In 2020, a state of emergency (SOE) was enforced by the Japanese government,which included temporary school closures with the aim of overcoming COVID-19spread, which prevented access to school lunches. We evaluated the relationshipbetween meal quality and guardians' literacy of meal preparation for a nationallyrepresentative sample of 1107 Japanese schoolchildren (aged 10-14 years) before, during, and after the SOE on the basis of 7 questions scored using a 5-pointLikert scale. The guardians' literacy of meal preparation for children wasdivided into quartiles, with Q1 and Q4 including participants with the lowest andhighest scores on food literacy, respectively. School lunch menu was handed outmonthly to each household by their classroom teacher. The consumption of (i)meat, fish, or eggs and (ii) vegetables at least twice a day indicated"well-balanced dietary intake", which was less frequent in all four quartiles,especially for Q1 and Q2, during compared to before the SOE. The relative riskincreases (95% CI) were Q1: -40.6% (-41.4% to -39.8%; p<0.001), Q2: -34.0%(-34.7% to -33.3%; p<0.001), Q3: -13.1% (-13.8% to -12.4%; p<0.001), and Q4:-15.3% (-16.0% to -14.7%; p<0.001), adjusted for sex, age, BMI, equivalent incomeadjusted for the number of household members, and educational level of parents.The interaction p was <0.001 for Q1-3 vs. Q4. Guardians with low total scoreswere significantly more likely to have less time, mental capacity, and financial ability to prepare meals after the SOE. Therefore, schoolchildren's meal quality deteriorated during the SOE, particularly among those with guardians with lowfood literacy even after adjustment for household income level and guardians'educational level.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies play a critical role in COVID-19 preventionand treatment but are challenged by viral evolution and the emergence of novelescape variants. Importantly, the recently identified Omicron sublineagesBA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 are rapidly becoming predominant in various countries. Bydetermining polyclonal serum activity of 50 convalescent or vaccinatedindividuals against BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/5, we reveal afurther reduction in BA.4/5 susceptibility to vaccinee sera. Most notably,delineation of sensitivity to an extended 163-antibody panel demonstratespronounced antigenic differences with distinct escape patterns among Omicronsublineages. Antigenic distance and/or higher resistance may therefore favorimmune-escape-mediated BA.4/5 expansion after the first Omicron wave. Finally,while most clinical-stage monoclonal antibodies are inactive against Omicronsublineages, we identify promising antibodies with high pan-SARS-CoV-2neutralizing potency. Our study provides a detailed understanding ofOmicron-sublineage antibody escape that can inform on effective strategiesagainst COVID-19.

AB  - Although COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, multiple pathogenic coronavirusspecies exist, urging on development of multispecies coronavirus vaccines. Herewe develop prototype lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccine candidates againstSARS-CoV-2 Delta, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, and we test how multiplexing LNP-mRNAs can induce effective immune responses in animal models. Triplex and duplexLNP-mRNA vaccinations induce antigen-specific antibody responses againstSARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiles theglobal systemic immune repertoires and respective transcriptome signatures ofvaccinated animals, revealing a systemic increase in activated B cells anddifferential gene expression across major adaptive immune cells. Sequentialvaccination shows potent antibody responses against all three species,significantly stronger than simultaneous vaccination in mixture. These datademonstrate the feasibility, antibody responses, and single-cell immune profiles of multispecies coronavirus vaccination. The direct comparison betweensimultaneous and sequential vaccination offers insights into optimization ofvaccination schedules to provide broad and potent antibody immunity against threemajor pathogenic coronavirus species.

TI  - Risk factors influencing seroconversion after inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people living with obesity.
LID - 10.1159/000525555 [doi]
AB  - Introduction To investigate the antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spikeantigens, and the risk factors affecting antibody levels in people living withobesity (PwO) after inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Corona Vac) administration.Methods 169 consecutive patients with obesity who visited the Center for Obesity Management at Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical FacultyHospitals, between May and August 2021, were invited to the study. The non-obese control group was recruited from 191 subjects who visited the CerrahpasaHospitals Vaccination Unit. The study group and the non-obese control group have already received two doses of inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgGNucleocapsid Antibody Antibody Test was administered to patients and controlsubjects to discover those who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourty onepatients who had prior infection and received two doses of vaccine were alsoincluded in the study as a subgroup. Blood samples were taken on the 3rd to 4thweek after the second vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers were determinedby quantitative serological methods. Results Antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2spike antigen of individuals with BMI 30.0 kg/m2 were significantly lower thanthose with BMI<30 kg/m2 (p= 0.001) in the study group. Moreover, the antibodytiters in people with BMI 30.0 kg/m2 were significantly lower than in thosehaving a BMI<30.0 kg/m2 in the subgroup (p=0.03). Age (p=0.03), BMI (p=0.006) andhypertension (p=0.03) were found to be independent risk factors for antibodyresponse in people living with obesity. Women with non-prior SARS-CoV-2 infectionshowed a significantly higher antibody response then men (p=0.001). ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 -Immunoglobulin G antibody levels against inactive (CoronaVac) vaccinewere found to be lower in people living with obesity (PwO) compared to non-obese individuals. Antibody titers may be measured and booster doses should bedelivered accordingly in PwO for optimal protection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most U.S. medical schoolsacutely transitioned from regimented in-person learning to highly flexiblevirtual asynchronous learning. This transition at our medical school provided aunique opportunity to evaluate if and how students adapted their academic andpersonal lives in response. METHODS: Medical students in a single class that madethis transition were retrospectively provided with 24-hour diaries for threeperiods - one shortly before the transition, a second early in the transition,and third several months into the transition - and asked to select the academicor personal activities done in each hour. The percentage of medical studentsperforming each activity each hour was analyzed, as was the time spent on eachactivity per day, and per morning, afternoon, per evening within the day.RESULTS: Overall study time did not change in either virtual period but shiftedsignificantly to the morning (6 AM to 12 PM). Time spent studying in groups fell significantly during both virtual periods, concordant with a significant increasein alone study time in the early virtual period. Early in the transition tovirtual learning, students replaced in-person didactics with online facultylectures; several months later in virtual learning, they had replaced onlinefaculty lectures with commercial products. There was no significant change intime spent on specific personal activities. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent withextensive constraints imposed by the heavy cognitive load of a medical schoolcurriculum, students did not significantly change their overall study time andany self-care-related activities in the transition to virtual learning. However, transitioning to virtual learning allowed our students to adapt their studystrategies, i.e. reducing group study time and increasing lone studying time.Furthermore, students shifted studying time to the morning to optimize themanagement of the cognitive task-load they faced.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 easily infects human monocytes, macrophages and possibly dendriticcells (DCs), causing dysfunctions of these important antigen presenting cells(APCs). Observed DC dysfunctions facilitate improper antigen presentation, which obviously results T cell anergy, exhaustion and apoptosis, thus, may becontributing significantly in SARS-CoV-2 infection associated lymphopenia. NeemLeaf Glycoprotein or NLGP has enormous role in altered DC functions, thereby,offering optimum T cell mediated cytotoxicity, as experienced from cancer system.Such NLGP guided correction of altered DCs might also be effective to generateproper SARS-CoV-2-specific effector and central memory T cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to address the association betweeninterstitial lung disease and the risk for severity and mortality among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The electronic databases ofPubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were systematically searched. The pooled effectsize with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was computed by a random-effectsmeta-analysis model. Heterogeneity test, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis,meta-regression analysis, Begg's test and Egger's test were performed. RESULTS: Atotal of sixteen eligible studies with 217,260 COVID-19 patients were enrolled inthis meta-analysis. The findings based on adjusted effect estimates indicatedthat pre-existing interstitial lung disease was significantly associated withhigher risk for COVID-19 severity (pooled effect = 1.34 [95 % CI: 1.16-1.55]) andmortality (pooled effect = 1.26 [95 % CI: 1.09-1.46]). Consistent results wereobserved in the subgroup analysis stratified by sample size, age, the percentage of male patients, study design, setting, the methods for adjustment and thefactors for adjustment. The results of meta-regression demonstrated that samplesize, age and region might be the potential sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivityanalysis exhibited that our results were stable and robust. No publication biaswas observed in Egger's test and Begg's test. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis onthe basis of adjusted effect estimates demonstrated that pre-existinginterstitial lung disease was independently associated with significantly higher risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected cancercare and research by disrupting the prevention and treatment paths as well as thepreclinical, clinical, and translational research ecosystem. In Italy, this hasbeen particularly significant given the severity of the pandemic's impact and theintrinsic vulnerabilities of the national health system. However, whilstdetrimental, disruption can also be constructive and may stimulate innovation andprogress. The Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) has recognized theimpact of COVID-19 on cancer care continuum and research and proposes the '2021Matera statement' which aims at providing pragmatic guidance for policymakers andhealth care institutions to mitigate the impact of the global health crisis onItalian oncology and design the recovery plan for the post-pandemic scenario. Theinterventions are addressed both to the pillars (prevention, diagnosis,treatment, follow-up, health care professionals) and foundations of cancer care(communication and care relationship, system organization, resources, research,networking). The priorities to be implemented can be summarized in the MATERAacronym: Multidisciplinarity; Access to cancer care; Telemedicine andTerritoriality; Equity, ethics, education; Research and resources; Alliancebetween stakeholders and patients.

TI  - Students' Perceptions, Educational Challenges, and Hope during the COVID-19Pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/cch.13036 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of U.S. students bothat home and at school; Little is known regarding how adolescents perceiveCOVID-19 has impacted (both positively and negatively) their academic and social lives, and how protective factors, such as hope, may assist with resilience.Importantly, not all pandemic experiences are necessarily negative, and positive perceptions, as well as potential protective factors, are key to understandingthe pandemic's role in students' lives. METHOD: Utilizing quantitative andqualitative approaches, the present study descriptively examined 726 6th through 12th grade (51% female, 53% white) students' perceptions of how COVID-19 related to educational and life disruptions, and positive aspects of their lives, within the United States. Analyses additionally explored the role of pre-pandemic hopein improving feelings of school connectedness during the pandemic. RESULTS:Results showed that most students felt that switching to online learning had beendifficult and their education had suffered at least moderately, with a sizableproportion of students feeling less academic motivation compared to last year.When asked to share qualitative answers regarding perceived challenges andpositive aspects of life, themes were consistent with quantitative perceptions.Students' pre-pandemic hope positively predicted students' feelings of schoolconnectedness. CONCLUSIONS: Findings paint a complex picture of youth's COVID-19 experiences and have implications for proactive ways to support students asCOVID-19 continues to affect daily life and educational structures and practices.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Minority populations in the United States face a disproportionateburden of illness from COVID-19 infection and have lower vaccination ratescompared with other groups. This study estimated the equity implications ofincreased COVID-19 vaccination in the United States, with a focus on the numberof cases, hospitalizations, and deaths avoided. STUDY DESIGN: This was anobservational real-world modeling study. METHODS: Data from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used to identify the remainingunvaccinated US population by county, age, and race as of October 22, 2021. Thenumber of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths avoided were calculatedbased on case incidence and death data from the CDC, along with data on race- andage-specific hospitalization multipliers, under a scenario in which half of theremaining unvaccinated population per county, race, and age group obtained a fullvaccine regimen. RESULTS: Vaccinating half of the remaining unvaccinatedpopulation in each age and race subgroup within counties would result in anestimated 22.09 million COVID-19 cases avoided, 1.38 million hospitalizationsavoided, and 150,000 deaths avoided over 12 months. Some minority groups,particularly Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, were projected to experience substantial benefits from increased vaccination rates as they face both lowervaccination rates and worse outcomes if infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS:Increasing COVID-19 vaccination in the United States not only benefits thepopulation as a whole but also serves as a potentially useful lever to reduce thedisproportionate burden of COVID-19 illness among minority populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, internal European borders weretemporarily re-established to mitigate the outbreak. Much research on pandemicborder control measures has focused on quantifying their effectiveness forinfectious disease control as well as on their social consequences forcross-border life in the European Union. However, little attention has been paid to the impacts for the practice and organisation of cross-border public health.To address this gap, the present study analysed the experiences and perspectives of public health professionals working in European border regions regardingborder control measures in the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitativeinterview-based study. METHODS: In total, 27 semistructured interviews withpublic health professionals were conducted in the border regions between Germany,the Netherlands and Belgium. Participants were asked about their perspectives on border control and the spread of COVID-19 in the region. Interviews wereperformed between December 2020 and April 2021 and carried out in German,English, Dutch and French. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, borders hadbecome largely invisible with extensive cross-border social life and mobility.Participants were sceptical about the role of cross-border mobility as a pandemicdriver and consequently the effectiveness of enforcing border control forreducing the spread of COVID-19 in their border regions. At the same time,participants raised concerns about the negative consequences for the socialfabric and provision of cross-border public health. CONCLUSIONS: Public healthprofessionals highlighted the uncertain role of border control measures forregional infectious disease control in border regions. Rather than bordercontrol, sustainable cross-border communication and collaboration is crucial toensure effective pandemic management in border regions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse associations between theCOVID-19 pandemic, alcohol consumption and anxiety symptoms among people withself-reported disabilities and family caregivers in Latin America and theCaribbean. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with secondary data analysis ofthe 'Alcohol Use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America and theCaribbean', a Web-based cross-sectional survey conducted by the Pan AmericanHealth Organisation between March and June 2020. METHODS: Descriptive analyseswere conducted on the individual, social environment characteristics, COVID-19infection, quarantine compliance, anxiety symptoms (measured by GeneralizedAnxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7]) and change in frequency of heavy episodicdrinking during the pandemic. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyseassociations among individuals with self-reported disabilities with anxietysymptoms and change in frequency of heavy episodic drinking during the pandemic. RESULTS: Family caregivers were more compliant with COVID-19 restrictive measuresthan individuals with and without disabilities. The majority of participants withdisabilities did not change their drinking patterns during the pandemic (64.3%); however, 28.1% reported increased consumption. People with disabilities were 2.17times more likely to have severe anxiety symptoms than no anxiety symptomsbetween March and June 2020 in Latin America and the Caribbean. CONCLUSIONS: Thisstudy observed a higher prevalence of the maintenance of heavy episodic drinking behaviour during the early phase of the pandemic in people with disabilities and family caregivers than in people without self-reported disabilities in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean. People with disabilities showed more severe anxietysymptoms than those without disabilities, highlighting the need to developinclusive health and quality-of-life policies to mitigate the effects of thepandemic in this vulnerable population.

TI  - Contextual forces shaping home-based healthcare services between 2010 and 2020:Insights from the social-ecological model and organizational theory.
LID - gnac113 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnac113 [doi]
AB  - Demands for home-based care have surged alongside population aging, preferencesfor aging in place, policy-driven reforms incentivizing lower hospitalutilization, and public concerns around COVID-19 transmissions in institutionalcare settings. However, at both macro and micro levels, sociopolitical andinfrastructural contexts are not aligned with the operational needs of homehealthcare organizations, presenting obstacles to home healthcare equity. Weintegrate the social-ecological model and organizational theory to highlightcontextual forces shaping the delivery of home-based care services between 2010and 2020. Placing home-based healthcare organizations at the center ofobservation, we discuss patterns and trends of service delivery as systematicorganizational behaviors reflecting the organizations' adaptations and responses to their surrounding forces. In this light, we consider the implications ofprovision and access to home care services for health equity, discuss topics thatare understudied, and provide recommendations for home-based healthcareorganizations to advance home healthcare equity. The paper represents a synthesisof recent literature and our research and industry experiences.

TI  - ENDOGENOUS FUNGAL ENDOPHTHALMITIS FOLLOWING COVID-19 INFECTION: CASE REPORT ANDREVIEW OF LITERATURE.
LID - 10.1097/ICB.0000000000001306 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a case of endogenous endophthalmitis (EE) following severeCOVID-19 disease, review patient outcomes with EE following COVID-19 infection,review evidence regarding risk factors for developing EE. METHODS: Review ofhealth records, imaging, intravitreal injection, and pars plana vitrectomy forbilateral fungal EE following severe COVID-19 disease. Literature review onoutcomes in EE following COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: 63 year-old male withdiabetes and hypertension was admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 diseasefor 3 months. His stay required ICU admission, intubation, high-dosecorticosteroids, tocilizumab, and was complicated by bacteremia, empyema, andfungal esophagitis. He developed floaters and bilateral vision loss (visualacuity 20/40 OD, CF OS) with vitritis 2.5 months into his stay that did notrespond to intravitreal voriconazole. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed forboth eyes, resulting in visual acuity of 20/40 OD, 20/30 OS. Vitreous cultureswere positive for candida albicans. EE following COVID-19 disease has beenreported in 22 patients to date, and outcomes are poor, with 40%+ of eyes legallyblind (20/200 or worse). Although influenced by availability of imagingmodalities and degree of training of the evaluating physician, misdiagnosis canaffect (1/4) of cases, delaying treatment. Age, male gender, and diabetesincrease risk of severe COVID-19, which requires prolonged hospitalization,invasive catheretization, and immunosuppression, which in turn increases risk of nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: Low threshold for suspecting endogenousendophthalmitis in patients presenting with floaters and decreased visionfollowing severe COVID-19 disease is necessary to ensure prompt recognition andtreatment.

AB  - As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues globally, there arean increasing number of pediatric cases. Since the initial symptoms of COVID-19may overlap and co-exist with other respiratory infections typically affectingchildren, this review examines the use of computed tomography as a diagnostic andmanagement tool. Children with preexisting conditions may be particularly proneto a more severe course. This study reviews and analytically summarizes thefindings typically associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in contrast with other more usual lower respiratory tract infections.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agentof the disease COVID-19, first emerged in late December 2019 in China, and hassubsequently become a pandemic with unprecedented clinical impact. The virusappears to more severely affect older individuals and those with co-morbidmedical conditions, specifically those with chronic lung disease, obesity, heart failure and diabetes. Fortunately, children appear to be less severely affected, though mortality and severe disease have been reported. In addition, children'srole in spreading the disease (potentially through asymptomatic shedding of thevirus) remains an important area requiring further investigation. The emergenceof SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the importance of metagenomic next generationsequencing as a tool for pandemic investigation. Though no proven therapeuticoptions currently exist, ongoing genomic and clinical trial data may help inform the identification and development of both repurposed and novel therapeuticagents for use in this disease.

PG  - 177-189
LID - 10.1089/ped.2020.1241 [doi]
AB  - Background: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)pandemic is a health care emergency across the world. Although mitigationmeasures, such as social distancing and face masks, have attempted to slow thespread of the infection, cases continue to rise. Children who are otherwisehealthy tend to develop a milder acute Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)infection and have lower mortality rates compared with adults. Methods:Guidelines and current primary and secondary literature on the treatment ofCOVID-19 and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children were searched and reviewed. There are 6 published pediatric series that included 252 children with acute COVID-19 infection and describe various treatments and outcomes. Results:Guidelines recommend treating pediatric patients similarly to adult patients.Currently, no prophylactic drug therapy has been shown to reduce the spread ofinfection. Treatment options for acute COVID-19 are limited to remdesivir andglucocorticoids for patients who require oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation.The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin has not beenproven and their safety has been a concern. Other therapies that are beingexplored include interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 inhibitors. In children, an atypicalKawasaki-like disease emerged after recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and has beennamed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Nine case series,including 418 pediatric patients, described pharmacotherapies used and patientoutcomes. These pharmacotherapies included intravenous immune globulin andglucocorticoids and in some patients, IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors. Conclusion: Giventhe paucity of data in children, this article presents currently recommendedpharmacotherapies for the treatment of acute COVID-19 infection in adult patientsand whenever available, in pediatric patients. Pharmacotherapies used in thetreatment of MIS-C in children are also reviewed.

PG  - 199-203
LID - 10.1089/ped.2020.1250 [doi]
AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic specialists were concerned about how to achieve the best control of pediatric asthmatic patients. Methods: A nationalsurvey was performed. Analysis of the mean of follow-up, complementary tests,health system (public/private/both), availability of severe asthma units, andgeographic location (cities with high COVID-19 prevalence vs. other cities withlow prevalence). Differences were analyzed using contingency tables and Pearson'schi-squared test. Results: We obtained 95 responses, mostly from cities with ahigh disease prevalence (39; 52%). Only 29 (38.6%) of respondents provided carein a severe asthma unit. Severe asthmatic children were followed up mainly bytelephone (68; 90.7%) and by in-person visits (32; 42.7%). Face-to-face care was less frequent in cities with a high prevalence of COVID-19 when compared withsmaller cities (P = 0.044). Some of the surveyed physicians had discontinuedpatient follow-up as they were caring for patients with COVID-19 (7; 9.3%). Ofall specialists surveyed, 45.3% did not evaluate severe asthmatic children withany means of testing. Pulmonary function tests were scarcely implemented. Bloodtests were the most common test performed (45.3%). Specialists working in asevere asthma unit carried out more pulmonary function tests (P = 0.019).Peculiarly, moderate persistent asthmatics underwent more spirometries in cities with a high prevalence rate (P = 0.03). Follow-up of asthmatic children duringthe pandemic was perceived to be reduced or altogether inexistent by 42.7% ofrespondents when compared with a similar season outside of this emergencysituation. Remarkably, the perception that better management of asthma wasdelivered during the pandemic by those working in cities with a high prevalenceof COVID-19 versus other regions. Conclusions: Pediatric asthma control iscrucial to decrease the future risk presented by the condition. New technologies and severe asthma units may become key tools in global health emergencies such asthe COVID-19 pandemic.

LID - 10.1089/ped.2020.1300 [doi]
AB  - The surge in COVID-19 cases during the 2020 Spring led to a nationwide shortageof albuterol inhalers. As a new surge has begun, shortages may make it difficult for patients with obstructive lung disease, including children with asthma, toobtain refills. Since there is no evidence that albuterol relieves symptoms inCOVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms not caused by bronchospasm, it isreasonable for clinicians to not prescribe it for COVID-19 patients unless theyalso have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB  - The aim of this randomized, controlled trial is to determine whetheranti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin protects against severe COVID-19 in severelyimmunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patients. Patients were randomlyassigned to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (COVIG) or intravenousimmunoglobulin without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Severe COVID-19 was observed in twoout of ten (20%) patients treated with COVIG compared to seven out of eight (88%)in the IVIG control group (p = 0.015, Fisher's exact test). COVIG may be avaluable treatment in severely immunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patientsand should be considered when no monoclonal antibody therapies are available. Thetrial was registered at www.trialregister.nl (#NL9436).

AB  - We evaluated the performance of nasal and nasopharyngeal Standard Q COVID-19 Agtests (SD Biosensor) and the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (nasal, Abbott)against the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay during the Omicron (21 M, 21K and21L) wave in South Africa. Overall, all evaluated tests performed well with high level of sensitivity (ranging from 77.78-81.42%) and excellent specificity values(>99%). The sensitivity of rapid antigen tests increased above 90% in sampleswith Ct <20, and all three tests performed best within first week of symptomonset. The Panbio Ag test performed best in the context of Omicron 21Linfections, that were also characterised by significantly lower Ct valuescompared to infections with 21K and 21 M.

LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac318 [doi]
AB  - To inform public health policy, it is critical to monitor COVID-19 vaccineeffectiveness (VE), including against acquiring infection. We estimated VE using self-reported vaccination in a retrospective cohort of repeat blood donors whodonated during the first half of 2021, demonstrating a viable approach formonitoring of VE via serological surveillance. Using Poisson regression, weestimated an overall VE of 88.8% (95% CI: 86.2-91.1), adjusted for demographiccovariates and variable baseline risk. Time since first reporting vaccination,age, race-ethnicity, region, and calendar time were statistically significantpredictors of incident infection.

LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac331 [doi]
AB  - Several monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (mAbs) have received emergencyauthorization for COVID-19 treatment. However, most of these mAbs are not active against the highly mutated Omicron SARS-CoV-2 subvariants. We have tested apolyclonal approach of equine anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab')2 antibodies that achieved a high level of neutralizing potency against all SARS-CoV-2 VoCs tested includingOmicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12 and BA.4/5. A repertoire of antibodies targetingconserved epitopes in different regions of the spike protein could plausiblyaccount for this remarkable breadth of neutralization. These results warrant the clinical investigation of equine polyclonal F(ab')2 antibodies as a noveltherapeutic strategy against COVID-19.

TI  - Genetically Engineered MRI-Trackable Extracellular Vesicles as SARS-CoV-2Mimetics for Mapping ACE2 Binding In Vivo.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c03119 [doi]
AB  - The elucidation of viral-receptor interactions and an understanding ofvirus-spreading mechanisms are of great importance, particularly in the era of a pandemic. Indeed, advances in computational chemistry, synthetic biology, andprotein engineering have allowed precise prediction and characterization of such interactions. Nevertheless, the hazards of the infectiousness of viruses, theirrapid mutagenesis, and the need to study viral-receptor interactions in a complexin vivo setup call for further developments. Here, we show the development ofbiocompatible genetically engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) that displaythe receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 on their surface as coronavirusmimetics (EVs(RBD)). Loading EVs(RBD) with iron oxide nanoparticles makes themMRI-visible and, thus, allows mapping of the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptorsnoninvasively in live subjects. Moreover, we show that EVs(RBD) can be modifiedto display mutants of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, allowing rapid screening ofcurrently raised or predicted variants of the virus. The proposed platform thusshows relevance and cruciality in the examination of quickly evolving pathogenic viruses in an adjustable, fast, and safe manner. Relying on MRI forvisualization, the presented approach could be considered in the future to mapligand-receptor binding events in deep tissues, which are not accessible toluminescence-based imaging.

TI  - Evaluation of a state-wide effort to improve COVID-19 infection control inMassachusetts nursing homes.
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the deadly 2020 SARS-CoV-2 surge in nursing homes (NHs),Massachusetts (MA) initiated a multicomponent infection control intervention tomitigate its spread. METHODS: We aimed to assess the intervention's impact bycomparing the weekly risk of PCR-confirmed infections among MA NH residents tothose in neighboring New England states, all managed similarly by a single NHprovider. We studied 2085 residents in 20 MA NHs and 4493 residents in 45comparator facilities. The intervention included: (1) A 28-item infection controlchecklist of best practices, (2) incentive payments to NHs contingent on scoring >/=24 on the checklist, meeting 6 core competencies, testing residents and staff for SARS-COV-2 RNA, uploading data, and enabling virtual visits; (3) on-site and virtual infection control consultations for deficient facilities; (4) 6 weeklywebinars; (5) continuous communication with the MA Department of Public Health;and (6) access to personal protective equipment, temporary staff, and SARS-CoV-2 testing. Weekly rates of infection were adjusted for county COVID-19 prevalence. RESULTS: The adjusted risk of infection started higher in MA, but declined morerapidly in its NHs compared to similarly managed facilities in other states. The decline in infection risk during the early intervention period was 53% greater inMA than in Comparator States (state-by-time interaction HR = 0.47; 95% CI0.37-0.59). By the late intervention period, the risk of infection continued todecline in both groups, and the change from baseline in MA was marginally greaterthan that in the Comparator States (interaction HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.64-1.00).CONCLUSIONS: The MA NH intervention was associated with a more rapid reduction inthe rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to similarly managed NHs inneighboring states. Although several unmeasured factors may have confounded ourresults, implementation of the MA model may help rapidly reduce high rates ofinfection and prevent future COVID-19 surges in NHs.

AB  - Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many dashboards have emerged asuseful tools to monitor its evolution, inform the public, and assist governments in decision-making. Here, we present a globally applicable method, integrated in a daily updated dashboard that provides an estimate of the trend in the evolutionof the number of cases and deaths from reported data of more than 200 countriesand territories, as well as 7-d forecasts. One of the significant difficulties inmanaging a quickly propagating epidemic is that the details of the dynamic neededto forecast its evolution are obscured by the delays in the identification ofcases and deaths and by irregular reporting. Our forecasting methodologysubstantially relies on estimating the underlying trend in the observed timeseries using robust seasonal trend decomposition techniques. This allows us toobtain forecasts with simple yet effective extrapolation methods in linear or logscale. We present the results of an assessment of our forecasting methodology anddiscuss its application to the production of global and regional risk maps.

TI  - Cell surface SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein modulates innate and adaptiveimmunity.
PG  - eabp9770
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abp9770 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) induces strong antibody (Ab) and T cellresponses. Although considered to be localized in the cytosol, we readily detect N on the surface of live cells. N released by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells orN-expressing transfected cells binds to neighboring cells by electrostatichigh-affinity binding to heparan sulfate and heparin, but not other sulfatedglycosaminoglycans. N binds with high affinity to 11 human chemokines, including CXCL12beta, whose chemotaxis of leukocytes is inhibited by N from SARS-CoV-2,SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV. Anti-N Abs bound to the surface of N-expressing cellsactivate Fc receptor-expressing cells. Our findings indicate that cell surface N manipulates innate immunity by sequestering chemokines and can be targeted byFc-expressing innate immune cells. This, in combination with its conservedantigenicity among human CoVs, advances its candidacy for vaccines that inducecross-reactive B and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human CoVs,including novel zoonotic strains.

TI  - Benefits of practice ownership among US private practice veterinarians extend to professional quality of life.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.2460/javma.22.05.0218 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To estimate the effects of practice ownership on wellbeing of USprivate practice veterinarians. Sample: 1,217 practice owners and 1,414 associateveterinarians (ie, nonowners) who participated in the 2021 AVMA Census ofVeterinarians and Practice Owners Survey. Procedures: A professional quality oflife instrument was used to measure compassion satisfaction (CS; a positiveattribute), burnout (BO), and secondary traumatic stress (STS) in practice ownersand nonowners both as scores and as score categories (low, moderate, and high CS,BO, and STS). For hypothesis tests, propensity score matching was used, withowners (n = 595) matched to nonowners (595) on several demographic and employmentfactors. Results: Owners had significantly (P < .001) higher CS scores (mean +/- SE, 34.1 +/- 0.3) and lower BO scores (26.1 +/- 0.3) than nonowners (32.8 +/- 0.3and 26.9 +/- 0.3, respectively), but STS scores were comparable between groups(27.4 +/- 0.3 and 27.5 +/- 0.3; P = .55). The prevalence of low CS scores andhigh BO scores was significantly (P < .001) higher for nonowners versus owners(53.8% vs 42.7% and 51.6% vs 46.4%, respectively). Both owners and nonowners had a high prevalence of high STS scores (81.8% and 83.2%, respectively; P = .53).Clinical Relevance: Results suggested that practice ownership confers a benefitto private practice veterinarians in terms of CS and BO, but not STS. Theprevalence of poor CS, BO, and STS scores was higher than reported previously for2016 to 2018, suggesting an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high prevalence of high STS scores in both groups warrants attention and action to protect thewelfare of the veterinary workforce and support optimal patient care.

TI  - Child emotional and behavioral difficulties and parent stress during COVID-19lockdown in Sri Lankan families.
PG  - e0271757
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271757 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Understanding parents' and children's mental health issues wouldhelp design population-specific intervention programs. The present study exploredparents' perceived stress and child emotions and behavior during the COVID-19lockdown among Sri Lankan families. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey wasconducted among Sri Lankan parents of children aged 11 to 17 years. Validatedinstruments (Perceived Stress Scale-PSS and Strengths and DifficultiesQuestionnaire-SDQ) evaluated parental stress, child emotions, andhyperactivity/inattention. Multiple linear regression assessed the predictors of mental health issues, including the interaction between age and gender. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-five parents responded to the survey (mothers:76%). One-thirdof parents experienced difficulties with their children during the pandemic.Emotions and hyperactivity-inattention problems measured via the SDQ scale werehigh among 38% of children, while the perceived stress was high in 79.2% ofparents. Overall, child emotions and hyperactivity-inattention increased withdecreasing age, increasing parent stress, having middle-income compared tohigh-income, and having a family member/close relative tested positive forCOVID-19. Hyperactivity-inattention (29.3%) was more than the emotional problems (22%) among children. The emotional problems were reported more with increasingparent stress, while child hyperactivity-inattention alone was reported more withdecreasing age, middle-income compared to high-income families, and increasingparent stress. Also, the interaction effect of age and gender indicated thathigher age was related to greater parent-reported hyperactivity-inattentionproblems in males. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight how the COVID-19 crisisand social isolation have contributed to increased parental stress and childemotional and hyperactivity-inattention problems. In addition to cautioning thehealthcare workers, socio-culturally appropriate preventive and supportive mentalhealth programs may help deal with further waves of COVID-19 or any other adversecircumstances.

PG  - e0272608
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272608 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We describe the rationale for and design of an innovative, nested,tripartite prospective observational cohort study examining whether relativeestrogen insufficiency-induced inflammation amplifies HIV-induced inflammation tocause end organ damage and worsen age-related co-morbidities affecting theneuro-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (Brain), skeletal (Bone), andcardiovascular (Heart/vessels) organ systems (BBH Study). METHODS: The BBH parentstudy is the Multicenter AIDS Cohort/Women's Interagency HIV Study CombinedCohort Study (MWCCS) with participants drawn from the Atlanta MWCCS site. BBHwill enroll a single cohort of n = 120 women living with HIV and n = 60HIV-negative women, equally distributed by menopausal status. The innovativemultipart nested study design of BBH, which draws on data collected by the parentstudy, efficiently leverages resources for maximum research impact and requiresextensive oversight and management in addition to careful implementation. Thepresence of strong infrastructure minimized BBH study disruptions due to changes in the parent study and the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: BBH is poised toprovide insight into sex and HIV associations with theneuro-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, skeletal, and cardiovascular systemsdespite several major, unexpected challenges.

PG  - e0270399
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270399 [doi]
AB  - We found evidence from two experiments that a simple set of gestural techniquescan improve the experience of online meetings. Video conferencing technology has practical benefits, but psychological costs. It has allowed industry, educationand social interactions to continue in some form during the covid-19 lockdowns.But it has left many users feeling fatigued and socially isolated, perhapsbecause the limitations of video conferencing disrupt users' ability tocoordinate interactions and foster social affiliation. Video Meeting Signals(VMS) is a simple technique that uses gestures to overcome some of theselimitations. First, we carried out a randomised controlled trial with over 100students, in which half underwent a short training session in VMS. Allparticipants rated their subjective experience of two weekly seminars, andtranscripts were objectively coded for the valence of language used. Compared to controls, students with VMS training rated their personal experience, theirfeelings toward their seminar group, and their perceived learning outcomes assignificantly higher. Also, they were more likely to use positive language andless likely to use negative language. A second, larger experiment replicated the first, and added a condition where groups were given a version of the VMStraining but taught to use emoji response buttons rather than gestures to signal the same information. The emoji-trained groups did not experience the sameimprovement as the VMS groups. By exploiting the specific benefits of gesturalcommunication, VMS has great potential to overcome the psychological problems of group video meetings.

TI  - Diagnostic Approaches For COVID-19: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c01697 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a transmitted respiratory disease causedby the infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). Although humankind has experienced several outbreaks of infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic has the highest rate of infection and has hadhigh levels of social and economic repercussions. The current COVID-19 pandemichas highlighted the limitations of existing virological tests, which have failed to be adopted at a rate to properly slow the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Pandemicpreparedness has developed as a focus of many governments around the world in theevent of a future outbreak. Despite the largely widespread availability ofvaccines, the importance of testing has not diminished to monitor the evolutionof the virus and the resulting stages of the pandemic. Therefore, developingdiagnostic technology that serves as a line of defense has become imperative. In particular, that test should satisfy three criteria to be widely adopted:simplicity, economic feasibility, and accessibility. At the heart of it all, itmust enable early diagnosis in the course of infection to reduce spread. However,diagnostic manufacturers need guidance on the optimal characteristics of avirological test to ensure pandemic preparedness and to aid in the effectivetreatment of viral infections. Nanomaterials are a decisive element in developingCOVID-19 diagnostic kits as well as a key contributor to enhance the performance of existing tests. Our objective is to develop a profile of the criteria thatshould be available in a platform as the target product. In this work, virusdetection tests were evaluated from the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic, andthen we generalized the requirements to develop a target product profile for aplatform for virus detection.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in hospital healthcare workers in Western Switzerlandat the end of the second pandemic wave.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001558 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. In early January 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirusdisease 2019) rapidly spread from China and caused a worldwidepandemic.Hypothesis. Healthcare workers represent a high-risk group for acquiringCOVID-19 and for nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Aim. We aimed to investigate over a 1 year period, across twopandemic waves, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in employees at a WesternSwitzerland public hospital.Methodology. A prospective observational SARS-CoV-2seroprevalence study was proposed to all hospital employees who enrolled on avoluntary basis.Results. Out of 594 participants recruited on a voluntary basis, 269 volunteers (45.3 %) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: this seroprevalence wastwice higher than that reported in the local community. Healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly higher oddsratio (OR) of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology [OR 3.19, 95 % confidenceinterval (CI) 2.16-4.74]. Symptoms showing the highest association with apositive serology were anosmia (OR 11.9, 95 % CI 5.58-30.9) and ageusia (OR 10.3,95 % CI 4.8-26.3). A total of 17.1 % (95 % CI 12.2-21.1 %) of SARS-CoV-2seropositive volunteers did not report a suspicion of COVID-19 in their personal history.Conclusion. Overall, we observed that the impact of the second SARS-CoV-2pandemic wave was considerable and significantly affected healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19.

LID - 10.1093/ehjqcco/qcac046 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to compare the outcomes of administration of LMWH and UFH in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematicallysearched several databases and included observational studies or clinical trials that compared the outcomes of administration of LMWH and UFH in hospitalizedCOVID-19 patients. A total of nine studies comprising 9637 patients wereincluded. Metanalysis showed that LMWH administration was associated with a lowerin-hospital mortality, and 28/30-day mortality compared with UFH administration([RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.32-0.61; I2:87.9%] and [RR 0.45; 95%CI 0.24-0.86; I2:78.4%],respectively). Patient with LMWH had shorter duration of hospital and ICU length of stay compared with UFH ([WMD -2.20; 95%CI -3.01 to -1.40; I2:0%] and [WMD-1.41; 95%CI -2.20 to -0.63; I2:0%], respectively). The risk of ICU admission or mechanical ventilation was lower in patients who received LMWH than those whoreceived UFH (RR 0.67; 95%CI 0.55-0.81; I2:67.3%). However, there was nodifference in the incidence of bleeding with LMWH compared with UFH (RR 0.27;95%CI 0.07-1.01; I2:64.6%). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis showed thatadministration of LMWH was associated with better outcomes compared with UFH inhospitalized COVID-19 patients. Prospective cohorts and RCTs are urgently needed in exploring the definitive effect of LMWH to provide direct high-certaintyevidence. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021271977.

TI  - Inpatient virtual shared medical appointments to improve health literacy,increase patient self-efficacy, and reduce provider burnout in acutecerebrovascular pathology patients and their caregivers: a pilot study.
PG  - E12
LID - 10.3171/2022.4.FOCUS21764 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Admission to the hospital for an acute cerebrovascular condition such as stroke or brain hemorrhage can be a traumatic and disorienting experience for patients and their family members. The COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified this experience in addition to exacerbating clinician and resident burnout. Toameliorate some of these concerns, a team of resident and medical studenttrainees implemented a virtual shared medical appointment (vSMA) program forinpatients with acute cerebrovascular disorders and their caregivers. The authorshypothesized that an early intervention in the form of a vSMA improves patientand caregiver health literacy and preparedness while simultaneously educatingclinical trainees on effective communication skills and reducing clinicianburnout. METHODS: Patients and caregivers of admitted patients were identifiedthrough a census of neurosurgery, neurocritical care, and neurology electronicmedical records. A weekly 60-minute secure virtual session consisted ofintroductions and a 10-minute standardized presentation on cerebrovasculardisease management, followed by participant-guided discussion. Participantscompleted presession and postsession surveys. Through this small feasibilitystudy data were obtained regarding present challenges, both expected andunforeseen. RESULTS: A total of 170 patients were screened, and 13 patients and26 caregivers participated in at least 1 vSMA session. A total of 6 differenthealthcare providers facilitated sessions. The vSMA program receivedoverwhelmingly positive feedback from caregivers. Survey responses demonstratedthat 96.4% of caregivers and 75% of patients were satisfied with the session,96.4% of caregivers and 87.5% of patients would recommend this type ofappointment to a friend or family member, and 88.8% of providers reported feelingvalidated by conducting the session. The participant group had a 20% greaterpercentage of patients discharged home without home needs compared to thenonparticipant group. The primary obstacles encountered included technologicalfrustrations with the consent process and the sessions themselves. CONCLUSIONS:Implementation of a vSMA program at a tertiary care center during a pandemic was feasible. Themes caregivers expressed on the postsession survey included betterunderstanding of caring for a stroke patient and coping with the unpredictabilityof a patient's prognosis. The pandemic has precipitated shifts toward telehealth,but this study highlights the importance of avoiding marginalization of elderlyand less technologically inclined populations.

PG  - E5
LID - 10.3171/2022.3.FOCUS2247 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The adoption of telemedicine became a necessity during the COVID-19pandemic because patients found commuting to be difficult owing to travelrestrictions. Initially, audio-based teleconsultations were provided. Later, onthe basis of the feedback of patients and caregivers, the authors started toprovide video-based teleconsultations via WhatsApp. The authors subsequentlysurveyed the patients and caregivers to determine their satisfaction levels with telemedicine services. METHODS: An anonymized telephone survey of patients whohad participated in teleconsultation was conducted with a structuredquestionnaire. The responses were analyzed and their correlations with theperceived benefits and limitations of audio and video teleconsultation weredetermined. RESULTS: Three hundred respondents were included in the first roundof surveys, of whom 250 (83.3%) consented to video teleconsultation. Among therespondents who participated in both audio and video teleconsultations (n = 250),paired analysis showed that video teleconsultation was perceived as better interms of providing easier access to healthcare services (p < 0.001), saving time (p < 0.001), and satisfaction with the way patient needs were conveyed tohealthcare providers (p = 0.023), as well as in terms of adequacy of addressinghealthcare needs (p < 0.001) and consequently providing a higher rate of overall satisfaction (p < 0.001). For both audio and video teleconsultation, overallpatient satisfaction was significantly related to only previous exposure toWhatsApp. However, for video consultation, longer call duration (p = 0.023) wasan important independent factor. Video teleconsultation was preferable toface-to-face consultation irrespective of educational status, but highereducation was associated with preference for video teleconsultation. CONCLUSIONS:Both audio and video teleconsultation are viable cost-effective surrogates forin-person physical neurosurgical consultation. Although audio teleconsultation ismore user-friendly and is not restricted by educational status, videoteleconsultation trumps the former owing to a more efficient and satisfactorydoctor-to-patient interface.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators in the implementation of a telemedicine-basedoutpatient brain tumor surgery program.
PG  - E8
LID - 10.3171/2022.3.FOCUS2242 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite growing evidence on the benefits of outpatient oncologicalneurosurgery (OON), it is only performed in a few specialized centers and thereare no previous descriptions of established OON programs in Europe. Moreover,increasing application of telemedicine strategies, especially after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is drastically changingneurosurgical management, particularly in the case of vulnerable populations suchas neuro-oncological patients. In this context, the authors implemented an OONprogram in their hospital with telematic follow-up. Herein, they describe theprotocol and qualitatively analyze the barriers and facilitators of thedevelopment process. METHODS: An OON program was developed through the following steps: assessment of hospital needs, specific OON training, multidisciplinaryteam organization, and OON protocol design. In addition, the implementation phaseincluded training sessions, a pilot study, and continuous improvement sessions.Finally, barriers and facilitators of the protocol's implementation wereidentified from the feedback of all participants. RESULTS: An OON protocol wassuccessfully designed and implemented for resection or biopsy of supratentoriallesions up to 3 cm in diameter. The protocol included the patient's admission to the day surgery unit, noninvasive anesthetic monitoring, same-day discharge, and admission to the hospital-at-home (HaH) unit for telematic and on-sitepostoperative care. After a pilot study including 10 procedures in 9 patients,the main barriers identified were healthcare provider resistance to change, lack of experience in outpatient neurosurgery, patient reluctance, and limitations in the recruitment of patients. Key facilitators of the process were the patienteducation program, the multidisciplinary team approach, and the HaH-basedtelematic postoperative care. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating an OON program withtelematic follow-up in a European clinical setting is feasible. Nevertheless, it poses several barriers that can be overcome by identifying and maximizing keyfacilitators of the process. Among them, patient education, a multidisciplinaryteam approach, and HaH-based postoperative care were crucial to the success ofthe program. Future studies should investigate the cost-effectiveness oftelemedicine to assess potential cost savings, from reduced travel and waittimes, and the impact on patient satisfaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantlychanged clinical practice across US healthcare. Increased adoption oftelemedicine has emerged as an alternative to in-person contact forpatient-physician interactions. The aim of this study was to analyze the impactof telemedicine on workflow and care delivery from January 2019 to December 2021 in a neurosurgical department at a quaternary care center. METHODS: Prospectivelycaptured data on clinic appointment utilization, duration, and outcomes werequeried. Visits were divided into in-person visits and telemedicine appointments,categorized as follow-up visits of previously surgically treated patients,internal consultations, new patient visits, and early postoperative returns aftersurgery. Appointment volume was compared pre- and postpandemic using March 2020as the pandemic onset. Clinical efficiency was measured by time to appointment,rate of on-time appointments, proportion of appointments resulting in surgicalintervention (surgical yield), and patient-reported satisfaction, the lattermeasured as the proportion of patients indicating "high likelihood to recommendpractice." RESULTS: A total of 54,562 visits occurred, most commonly forfollow-up for previously operated patients (51.8%), internal new patientreferrals (24.5%), and external new patient referrals (19.8%). Total visit volumewas stable pre- to postpandemic (1521.3 vs 1512, p = 0.917). However, in-personvisits significantly decreased (1517/month vs 1220/month, p < 0.001), with anadir in April 2020, while telemedicine appointment utilization increasedsignificantly (0.3% vs 19.1% of all visits). Telemedicine utilization remainedstable throughout the 1st calendar year following the pandemic. Telemedicineappointments were associated with shorter time to appointment than in-personvisits both before and after the pandemic onset (0-5 days from appointmentrequest: 60% vs 33% vs 29.8%, p < 0.001). Patients had on-time appointments in87% of telemedicine encounters. Notably, telemedicine appointments resulted insurgery in 31.8% of internal consultations or new patient visits, a significantlylower rate than that for in-person visits (51.8%). After the widespreadintegration of telemedicine, patient satisfaction for all visits was higher than before the pandemic onset (85.9% vs 88.5%, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine use significantly increased following the pandemic onset, compensating forobserved decreases in face-to-face visits. Utilization rates have remainedstable, suggesting effective integration, and delays between referrals andappointments were lower than for in-person visits. Importantly, telemedicineintegration was not associated with a decrease in overall patient satisfaction,although telemedicine appointments had a lower surgical yield. These data suggestthat telemedicine smoothened the impact of the pandemic on clinical workflow and helped to maintain continuity and quality of outpatient care.

TI  - The Impact of COVID-19 on Physician-Scientist Trainees and Faculty in the United States: A National Survey.
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000004802 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Physician-scientists have long been considered an endangered species,and their extended training pathway is vulnerable to disruptions. This studyinvestigated the effects of COVID-19-related challenges on the personal lives,career activities, stress levels, and research productivity ofphysician-scientist trainees and faculty. METHOD: The authors surveyed medicalstudents (MS), graduate students (GS), residents/fellows (R/F), and faculty (F)using a tool distributed to 120 U.S. institutions with MD-PhD programs inApril-June 2020. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to comparedifferences between groups. Machine learning was employed to select variables formultivariate logistic regression analyses aimed at identifying factors associatedwith stress and impaired productivity. RESULTS: The analyses included 1,929respondents (MS: n = 679, 35%; GS: n = 676, 35%; R/F: n = 274, 14%; F: n = 300,16%). All cohorts reported high levels of social isolation, stress from effectsof the pandemic, and negative impacts on productivity. R/F and F respondents weremore likely than MS and GS respondents to report financial difficulties due toCOVID-19. R/F and F respondents with a dual degree expressed more impairedproductivity compared to those without a dual degree. Multivariate regressionanalyses identified impacted research/scholarly activities, financialdifficulties, and social isolation as predictors of stress and impairedproductivity for both MS and GS cohorts. For both R/F and F cohorts, impactedpersonal life and research productivity were associated with stress, whiledual-degree status, impacted research/scholarly activities, and impacted personallife were predictors of impaired productivity. More female than male respondents reported increased demands at home. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey ofphysician-scientist trainees and faculty found a high incidence of stress andimpaired productivity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding thechallenges faced and their consequences may improve efforts to support thephysician-scientist workforce in the post-pandemic period.

TI  - Teledermatology to Facilitate Patient Care Transitions From Inpatient toOutpatient Dermatology: Mixed Methods Evaluation.
PG  - e38792
LID - 10.2196/38792 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both clinicians and patients have increasingly turned to telemedicineto improve care access, even in physical examination-dependent specialties suchas dermatology. However, little is known about whether teledermatology supportseffective and timely transitions from inpatient to outpatient care, which is acommon care coordination gap. OBJECTIVE: Using mixed methods, this study soughtto retrospectively evaluate how teledermatology affected clinic capacity,scheduling efficiency, and timeliness of follow-up care for patientstransitioning from inpatient to outpatient dermatology care. METHODS:Patient-level encounter scheduling data were used to compare the number andproportion of patients who were scheduled and received in-clinic or videodermatology follow-ups within 14 and 90 days after discharge across 3 phases:June to September 2019 (before teledermatology), June to September 2020 (earlyteledermatology), and February to May 2021 (sustained teledermatology). The time from discharge to scheduling and completion of patient follow-up visits for each care modality was also compared. Dermatology clinicians and schedulers were also interviewed between April and May 2021 to assess their perceptions ofteledermatology for postdischarge patients. RESULTS: More patients completedfollow-up within 90 days after discharge during early (n=101) and sustained(n=100) teledermatology use than at baseline (n=74). Thus, the clinic's capacity to provide follow-up to patients transitioning from inpatient increased frombaseline by 36% in the early (101 from 74) and sustained (100 from 74)teledermatology periods. During early teledermatology use, 61.4% (62/101) of the follow-ups were conducted via video. This decreased significantly to 47% (47/100)in the following year, when COVID-19-related restrictions started to lift(P=.04), indicating more targeted but still substantial use. The proportion ofpatients who were followed up within the recommended 14 days after discharge did not differ significantly between video and in-clinic visits during the early(33/62, 53% vs 15/39, 38%; P=.15) or sustained (26/53, 60% vs 28/47, 49%; P=.29) teledermatology periods. Interviewees agreed that teledermatology would continue to be offered. Most considered postdischarge follow-up patients to be idealcandidates for teledermatology as they had undergone a recent in-personassessment and might have difficulty attending in-clinic visits because ofcompeting health priorities. Some reported patients needing technologicalsupport. Ultimately, most agreed that the choice of follow-up care modalityshould be the patient's own. CONCLUSIONS: Teledermatology could be an importanttool for maintaining accessible, flexible, and convenient care for recentlydischarged patients needing follow-up care. Teledermatology increased cliniccapacity, even during the pandemic, although the timeliness of care transitionsdid not improve. Ultimately, the care modality should be determined throughcommunication with patients to incorporate their and their caregivers'preferences.

TI  - Evaluation of a Digital Self-management Platform for Patients With ChronicIllness in Primary Care: Qualitative Study of Stakeholders' Perspectives.
PG  - e38424
LID - 10.2196/38424 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Population aging and multimorbidity has led to increasing chroniccare needs associated with new challenges in managing growing costs, risinghealth care professional workloads, and the adoption of rigorous guidelines.These issues could all benefit from greater digitalization and a morepatient-centered approach to chronic care, a situation brought to the fore by theCOVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about real-life use in primary care.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the views, thoughts, usability, andexperiences concerning a recently introduced digital self-care platform forchronic conditions in 3 Dutch primary care practices. METHODS: We conducted anexplorative study combining questionnaires and interviews among patients andgeneral practitioners from 3 general practices that used the digital platform.Questionnaires were sent to patients in each practice to seek the views andexperiences of both patient nonusers (n=20) and patient users (n=58) of theplatform, together with standardized questionnaires about illness perception and quality of life. In addition, patients (n=15) and general practitioners (n=4) whoused the platform took part in semistructured interviews. We transcribedinterviews verbatim and performed qualitative content analysis using a deductive approach. The results of the questionnaires were analyzed with descriptiveanalysis. RESULTS: Among patients who had not actively used the platform but had received an explanation, only 35% (7/20) would recommend its use due to concerns over communication and handling. However, this percentage increased to 76.3%(45/59) among the people who actively used the platform. Interviews with patientsand general practitioners who used the platform uncovered several key benefits,including reduced time requirements, reduced workload, improved care quality, andimproved accessibility due to the greater patient-centeredness and use ofdifferent communication tools. In addition, the self-management tool led togreater patient autonomy and empowerment. Although users considered the platform feasible, usable, and easy to use, some technical issues remained and somepatients expressed concerns about the reduction in human contact and feedback.CONCLUSIONS: The overall experience and usability of the platform was good.Support for the online self-management platform for chronic care increased whenpatients actively used the tool and could experience or identify importantadvantages. However, patients still noted several areas for improvement that needto be tackled in future iterations. To ensure benefit in the wider population, wemust also evaluate this platform in cohorts with lower digital and healthliteracy.

TI  - Remote Moderator and Observer Experiences and Decision-making During UsabilityTesting of a Web-Based Empathy Training Portal: Content Analysis.
PG  - e35319
LID - 10.2196/35319 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 restrictions severely curtailed empirical endeavors thatinvolved in-person interaction, such as usability testing sessions for technologydevelopment. Researchers and developers found themselves using web-basedmoderation for usability testing. Skilled remote moderators and observers arefundamental in this approach. However, to date, more empirical work is neededthat captures the perceptions and support needs of moderators and observers intesting situations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to identify remotemoderator and observer participant experiences and their use of certain tools to capture feedback of users as they interact with the web browser application.METHODS: This research is part of a broader study on an educational web browserapplication for nursing students to learn perspective taking and enhance theirperceptual understanding of a dialogue partner's thoughts and feelings. Thebroader study used a quantitative and think-aloud qualitative problem-discoveryusability study design. This case study explored written accounts of the remotemoderator and observer participants regarding their roles, experiences, andreactions to the testing protocol and their suggestions for improved techniquesand strategies for conducting remote usability testing. Content analysis was usedto analyze participants' experiences in the usability testing sessions. RESULTS: We collected data from 1 remote moderator and 2 remote observers. Five themeswere identified: dealing with personal stressors, dealing with user anxiety,maintaining social presence, ethical response to the study protocol, andcommunication during sessions. The participants offered recommendations for thedesign of future remote testing activities as well as evidence-informed training materials for usability project personnel. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findingscontribute to a growing body of endeavors to understand human-computerinteraction and its impact on remote moderator and observer roles. As technology rapidly advances, more remote usability testing will occur where the knowledgegleaned in this study can have an impact. Recommendations based on moderator and observer participant perspectives identify the need for more evidence-informedtraining materials for their roles that focus on web-based interpersonalcommunication skills, execution of user testing protocols, troubleshootingtechnology and test user issues, proficiency in web conferencing platforms,behavior analysis and feedback technologies, and time management.

AB  - Developing numerous nanotechnological designed tools to monitor the existence of SARS-CoV-2, and modifying its interactions address the global needs for efficientremedies required for the management of COVID-19. Herein, through amultidisciplinary outlook encompassing different fields such as thepathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, analysis of symptoms, and statistics ofneurological complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central andperipheral nervous systems have been testified. The anosmia (51.1%) and ageusia(45.5%) are reported the most frequent neurological manifestation.Cerebrovascular disease and encephalopathy were mainly related to severe clinicalcases. In addition, we focus especially on the various concerned physiologicalroutes, including BBB dysfunction, which transpired due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, direct and indirect effects of the virus on the brain, and also, the plausiblemechanisms of viral entry to the nerve system. We also outline thecharacterization, and the ongoing pharmaceutical applications of quantum dots as smart nanocarriers crossing the blood-brain barrier and their importance inneurological diseases, mainly SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations Moreover, themarket status, six clinical trials recruiting quantum dots, and the challengeslimiting the clinical application of QDs are highlighted.

TI  - Effectiveness Associated With BNT162b2 Vaccine Against Emergency Department andUrgent Care Encounters for Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Infection AmongAdolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years.
PG  - e2225162
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25162 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Data about the duration of protection of 2 and 3 doses of BNT162b2 inchildren and adolescents are needed to help inform recommendations for boostersin this age group. Objective: To evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) anddurability associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against Delta- and Omicron-relatedemergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters among adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and to estimate VE associated with 3 doses against these sameoutcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This test-negative case-controlstudy was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, an integratedhealth care system using electronic health records in the US. Participantsincluded Kaiser Permanente Southern California members ages 12 to 17 years withan ED or UC encounter from November 1, 2021, through March 18, 2022, for acuterespiratory infection who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via a reversetransction-polymerase chain reaction test. Analyses were conducted from March 21 to June 22, 2022. Exposures: BNT162b2 vaccination status ascertained fromelectronic health records and state registry data. Main Outcomes and Measures:The main outcome was VE associated with BNT162b2 against ED and UC encountersrelated to Delta or Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Analyses were conducted among 3168 adolescents, including 1004 with ED visits and 2164 with UC visits. Median (IQR) age was 15 (13-16) years, and 1461 (46.1%) were boys. Inadjusted analyses, VE associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against ED or UCencounters was highest within the first 2 months for both Delta (89% [95% CI, 69%to 96%]) and Omicron (73% [95% CI, 54% to 84%]) variants but waned to 49% (95%CI, 27% to 65%) for the Delta variant and 16% (95% CI, -7% to 34%) for theOmicron variant at 6 months and beyond. A third dose of BNT162b2 was associatedwith improved protection against the Omicron variant (87% [95% CI, 72% to 94%])after a median (IQR) of 19 (9-32) days after dose 3. Conclusions and Relevance:These findings suggest that 2 doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine wereassociated with high levels of protection against ED and UC encounters related tothe Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the first few months aftervaccination. However, effectiveness waned over time, especially against Omicron. A third dose of BNT162b2 was associated with improved protection against Omicron beyond that seen initially after 2 doses, underscoring the importance of boostersfor adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccination Intentions, Concerns, and Facilitators Among US Parents ofChildren Ages 6 Months Through 4 Years.
PG  - e2227437
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.27437 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Children aged 6 months through 4 years have become eligible forCOVID-19 vaccination, but little is known about parental intentions regarding,concerns about, or facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination for this age group.Objectives: To evaluate parental intentions, concerns, and facilitators forCOVID-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months through 4 years and to helpinform the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices' deliberations and recommendations for COVID-19vaccination for children aged 6 months through 4 years. Design, Setting, andParticipants: This cross-sectional study fielded an online survey from February 2to 10, 2022, among a nonprobability sample of US parents of children aged 6months through 4 years who were recruited through Qualtrics using quota-basedsampling for respondent gender, race and ethnicity, and child age group. MainOutcomes and Measures: COVID-19 vaccination intentions, time to COVID-19vaccination, COVID-19 vaccination concerns and facilitators, and trusted COVID-19vaccination locations for children aged 6 months through 4 years. Results: Thefinal weighted sample of 2031 participants (73.5% participation rate) had morerespondents who identified as male (985; weighted percentage, 54.8%) or White(696; weighted percentage, 66.2%), were aged 25 to 49 years (1628; weightedpercentage, 85.6%), had at least a bachelor's degree (711; weighted percentage,40.0%), lived in a metropolitan area (1743; weighted percentage, 82.9%) or theSouth (961; weighted percentage, 43.4%), or received at least 1 dose of aCOVID-19 vaccine (1205; weighted percentage, 59.8%). Half of respondents (645;weighted percentage, 45.6%) indicated that they "definitely" or "probably" willvaccinate their child aged 6 months through 4 years once they became eligible.However, only one-fifth (396; weighted percentage, 19.0%) indicated they wouldget a COVID-19 vaccine for their child in this age group within 3 months of them becoming eligible for vaccination. Vaccine safety and efficacy were parents' top concerns, and receiving more information about safety and efficacy were the topfacilitators to COVID-19 vaccination for this age group. A doctor's office orclinic and local pharmacy were the most trusted COVID-19 vaccination locationsfor this age group. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that only a minority of parents of children in this age group are eager to vaccinate theirchildren within the first few months of eligibility, with widespread concernsabout COVID-19 vaccination for this age group. Thus, considerable efforts toincrease parental COVID-19 vaccine confidence for children aged 6 months through 4 years may be needed to maximize COVID-19 vaccination for this age group in the United States.

TI  - Left ventricular assist device implantation following multisystem inflammatorysyndrome in children due to SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1111/jocs.16821 [doi]
AB  - Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is rare, however, severehyperinflammatory condition in children generally weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2infection. A subset of MIS-C patients is presented with severe heart failure. We hereby report 8-year-old girl presenting acute severe left ventricular failure.Various medical treatments including inotropic agents and drugs related toSARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C were applied. However, venoarterial extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) was needed to be performed. Due to unsuccessfulattempts for ECMO weaning, left ventricular assist device was implanted to thepatient with temporary right ventricular support from ECMO.

TI  - Development and Modification of a Culturally Tailored Education Program toPrevent Breast Cancer in Korean Immigrant Women in New York City.
LID - 10.1007/s13187-022-02207-2 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in Korean American (KA) women. Inview of its high prevalence in these women, their low screening rates, and thecultural influence of BC risk factors in their lifestyles, we developed acommunity-based culturally tailored BC prevention program, the Korean BreastCancer Risk Reduction Program (KBCRRP). Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEDE and health belief models, the KBCRRP was developed to achieve four goals: (1) healthyweight, (2) physically active lifestyle, (3) healthy diet, and (4) BC screeningand adherence. KBCRRP combines effective multicomponent strategies for BCscreening and a group-based lifestyle intervention incorporating traditionalKorean health beliefs and is tailored for BC risk reduction. In this paper, weprovide an overview of the program, the process of program development,implementation, and evaluation, and modification during the COVID-19 pandemic.The initial program involved 8 weeks of in-person group education sessions led byinterdisciplinary healthcare professionals and 16 weeks of follow-up involvingsmartphone applications, phone calls, and text messaging from trained lifestylecoaches. Participants received opportunities to obtain free mammography duringthe program. After feasibility testing, the program was modified by incorporatingparticipants' feedback. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided the programusing the Zoom video platform. Participants' recruitment and retention during thepandemic was successful, reflecting the fact that virtual delivery of group-basededucation was a feasible and acceptable alternative to in-person sessions.Collaboration with community organizations serving the target population is thekey to developing and sustaining a successful community-based educationalprogram.

TI  - Social risk factors among individuals with a history of cancer during theCOVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1007/s11764-022-01235-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and its economicconsequences may disproportionately impact cancer survivors and their overallhealth-related quality of life. The objective of this study was to examinewhether cancer survivors experienced higher levels of financial strain or foodinsecurity compared to those without a history of cancer. METHODS: KaiserPermanente Research Bank (KPRB) study participants were invited to complete aseries of electronic surveys starting April 2020 to assess the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic. Participants who completed the initial survey and onefollow-up survey were included. The odds of financial strain and food insecurity in those with and without a history of cancer were estimated using multinomiallogistic regression. RESULTS: Cancer survivors (n = 16,231) had lower odds ofreporting "somewhat hard" (AOR = 0.77) and "very hard" (AOR = 0.67) financialstrain, and food insecurity "sometimes" (AOR = 0.70) and "often" (AOR = 0.55)compared to those with no history of cancer (n = 88,409). Non-Hispanic (NH) Blackand Hispanic cancer survivors had higher odds compared to NH Whites of reporting financial strain and food insecurity. Smokers and those with multiplecomorbidities had higher odds of reporting financial strain and food insecurityamong cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: While cancer survivors overall did notreport greater financial strain or food insecurity than individuals without ahistory of cancer, subsets of cancer survivors are experiencing greater socialrisks during the pandemic and should be prioritized for screening for social riskfactors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Incorporating screening for socialrisk factors into care coordination workflows for subsets of cancer survivorsshould be a priority.

TI  - Epidemiological Comparison of Four COVID-19 Waves in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo, March 2020-January 2022.
LID - 10.1007/s44197-022-00052-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Nationwide analyses are required to optimise and tailor activities tocontrol future COVID-19 waves of resurgence continent-wide. We comparedepidemiological and clinical outcomes of the four COVID-19 waves in theDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: This retrospective descriptiveepidemiological analysis included data from the national line list of confirmedCOVID-19 cases in all provinces for all waves between 9 March 2020 and 2 January 2022. Descriptive statistical measures (frequencies, percentages, case fatalityrates [CFR], test positivity rates [TPR], and characteristics) were comparedusing chi-squared or the Fisher-Irwin test. RESULTS: During the study period,72,108/445,084 (16.2%) tests were positive, with 9,641/56,637 (17.0%),16,643/66,560 (25.0%), 24,172/157,945 (15.3%), and 21,652/163,942 (13.2%) casesduring the first, second, third, and fourth waves, respectively. TPRsignificantly decreased from 17.0% in the first wave to 13.2% in the fourth wave as did infection of frontline health workers (5.2% vs. 0.9%). CFR decreased from 5.1 to 0.9% from the first to fourth wave. No sex- or age-related differences in distributions across different waves were observed. The majority of cases wereasymptomatic in the first (73.1%) and second (86.6%) waves, in contrast to thatin the third (11.1%) and fourth (31.3%) waves. CONCLUSION: Despite fewer reportedcases, the primary waves (first and second) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the DRCwere more severe than the third and fourth waves, with each wave being associatedwith a new SARS-CoV-2 variant. Tailored public health and social measures, andresurgence monitoring are needed to control future waves of COVID-19.

TI  - Exploration of Novel Lichen Compounds as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro:Ligand-Based Design, Molecular Dynamics, and ADMET Analyses.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-04103-3 [doi]
AB  - In the year 2019-2020, the whole world witnessed the spread of a disease calledCOVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. A number of effective drugs and vaccine has beenformulated to combat this outbreak. For the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs,the main protease (Mpro) is considered a key target as it has rare mutations and plays a crucial role in the replication of the SARS CoV-2. In this study, alibrary of selected lichen compounds was prepared and used for virtual screening against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using molecular docking, and several hits as potentialinhibitors were identified. Remdesivir was used as a standard inhibitor of Mprofor its comparison with the identified hits. Twenty-six compounds were identifiedas potential hits against Mpro, and these were subjected to in silico ADMETproperty prediction, and the compounds having favorable properties were selected for further analysis. After manual inspection of their interaction with thebinding pocket of Mpro and binding affinity score, four compounds, namely,variolaric acid, cryptostictinolide, gyrophoric acid, and usnic acid, wereselected for molecular dynamics study to evaluate the stability of complex. Themolecular dynamics results indicated that except cryptostictinolide, all thethree compounds made a stable complex with Mpro throughout a 100-ns simulationtime period. Among all, usnic acid seems to be more stable and effective against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In summary, our findings suggest that usnic acid, variolaricacid, and gyrophoric acid have potential to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 Mpro and act as a lead compounds for the development of antiviral drug candidates againstSARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Epidemiology, Clinical Profile, Intensive Care Needs and Outcome in Children withSARS-CoV-2 Infection Admitted to a Tertiary Hospital During the First and Second Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India.
LID - 10.1007/s12098-022-04283-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the epidemiological, clinical profile, intensive careneeds and outcome of children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection during thefirst and second waves of the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective studyof all children between 1 mo and 14 y, admitted to a dedicated COVID-19 hospital (DCH) during the first (1st June to 31st December 2020) and second waves (1stMarch to 30th June 2021). RESULTS: Of 217 children, 104 (48%) and 113 (52%) were admitted during the first and second waves respectively. One hundred fifty-two(70%) had incidentally detected SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 65 (30%) hadsymptomatic COVID-19. Comorbidities were noted in 137 (63%) children. Fifty-nine (27%) and 66 (30%) children required high-dependency unit (HDU) and ICU carerespectively. Severity of infection and ICU needs were similar during both waves.High-flow oxygen (n = 5, 2%), noninvasive ventilation [CPAP (n = 34, 16%) andBiPAP (n = 8, 5%)] and invasive ventilation (n = 45, 21%) were respiratorysupport therapies needed. NIV use was more during the second wave (26% vs. 13%; p= 0.02). The median (IQR) length (days) of DCH stay among survivors was longerduring the first wave [8 (6-10) vs. 5.5 (3-8); p = 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity, associated comorbidities, PICU and organ support need and mortalitywere similar in the first and second waves of the pandemic. Children admittedduring the second wave were younger, had higher proportion of NIV use and shorterlength of COVID-19 hospital stay.

AB  - Carotid free-floating thrombus (FFT) is very rarely diagnosed in patients withacute ischemic stroke. It is a real clinical emergency due to the significantrisk of death associated with thromboembolic complications. Herein, we presentthree patients with ischemic stroke caused by carotid FFT after less than 20 daysfrom administration of mRNA vaccine BNT162b1 (Pfizer/BioNTech) for Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To our knowledge, these are the first cases reporting carotid FTT following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

TI  - An overview on in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of lactoferrin: itsefficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
LID - 10.1007/s10534-022-00427-z [doi]
AB  - Beyond the absolute and indisputable relevance and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2vaccines, the rapid transmission, the severity of infection, the absence of theprotection on immunocompromised patients, the propagation of variants, the onset of infection and/or disease in vaccinated subjects and the lack of availabilityof worldwide vaccination require additional antiviral treatments. Since 1987,lactoferrin (Lf) is well-known to possess an antiviral activity related to itsphysico-chemical properties and to its ability to bind to both heparan sulfateproteoglycans (HSPGs) of host cells and/or surface components of viral particles.In the present review, we summarize in vitro and in vivo studies concerning theefficacy of Lf against DNA, RNA, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Recentstudies have revealed that the in vitro antiviral activity of Lf is alsoextendable to SARS-CoV-2. In vivo, Lf oral administration in early stage ofSARS-CoV-2 infection counteracts COVID-19 pathogenesis. In particular, the effectof Lf on SARS-CoV-2 entry, inflammatory homeostasis, iron dysregulation,iron-proteins synthesis, reactive oxygen formation, oxidative stress, gut-lungaxis regulation as well as on RNA negativization, and coagulation/fibrinolysisbalance will be critically reviewed. Moreover, the molecular mechanismsunderneath, including the Lf binding to HSPGs and spike glycoprotein, will bedisclosed and discussed. Taken together, present data not only support theapplication of the oral administration of Lf alone in asymptomatic COVID-19patients or as adjuvant of standard of care practice in symptomatic ones but alsoconstitute the basis for enriching the limited literature on Lf effectiveness forCOVID-19 treatment.

PG  - 18
LID - 10.1007/s00005-022-00657-6 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate soluble CD147 levels in COVID-19 and identify whether these areassociated with hyperinflammation and disease severity. One-hundred and nineCOVID-19 patients and 72 healthy blood donors were studied. Levels of CD147,matrix metalloproteases (MMP) and inflammatory markers were measured on hospital arrival, while the need for mechanical ventilation and the occurrence of deathduring hospitalization were recorded. CD147 levels were higher in COVID-19 (1.6, 1.0-2.3 vs 1.3, 1.0-1.6 ng/ml; P = 0.003) than controls. MMP-2 (9.2, 4.5-12.9 vs 4.2, 3.7-4.6 ng/ml; P < 0.001), MMP-3 (1.1, 0.9-1.3 vs 0.9, 0.7-1.0 ng/ml; P <0.001) and MMP-9 (0.9, 0.5-1.2 vs 0.4, 0.2-0.6 ng/ml; P < 0.001) were also higherin COVID-19, while MMP-1 (0.6, 0-1.4 vs 0.6, 0.3-0.7 ng/ml; P = 0.711) was notdifferent. Significant correlations were found between CD147 and MMP-2 (rho =0.34), MMP-3 (rho = 0.21), interleukin 6 (rho = 0.21), and theneutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (rho = 0.26). Furthermore, CD147 levels were higherin patients who required mechanical ventilation (1.8, 1.4-2.4 vs 1.2, 0.8-1.9ng/ml; P < 0.001) and in those who ultimately died (1.9, 1.4-2.7 vs 1.4, 0.9-1.9 ng/ml; P = 0.009). CD147 is elevated in COVID-19 and appears to contribute tohyperinflammation and disease severity.

AB  - PURPOSE/INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to describeosteoporosis-related care patterns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pandemic in Alberta, Canada, relative to the 3-year preceding. METHODS: Arepeated cross-sectional study design encompassing 3-month periods of continuous administrative health data between March 15, 2017, and September 14, 2020,described osteoporosis-related healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) andtreatment patterns. Outcomes included patients with osteoporosis-relatedhealthcare encounters, physician visits, diagnostic and laboratory test volumes, and treatment initiations and disruptions. The percent change between outcomeswas calculated, averaged across the control periods (2017-2019), relative to the COVID-19 periods (2020). RESULTS: Relative to the average control March to Juneperiod, all HCRU declined during the corresponding COVID-19 period. There was areduction of 14% in patients with osteoporosis healthcare encounters, 13% ingeneral practitioner visits, 9% in specialist practitioner visits, 47% in bonemineral density tests, and 13% in vitamin D tests. Treatment initiations declined43%, 26%, and 35% for oral bisphosphonates, intravenous bisphosphonates, anddenosumab, respectively. Slight increases were observed in the proportion ofpatients with treatment disruptions. In the subsequent June to September period, HCRU either returned to or surpassed pre-pandemic levels, when includingtelehealth visits accounting for 33-45% of healthcare encounters during the COVIDperiods. Oral bisphosphonate treatment initiations remained lower thanpre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the COVID-19 pandemicand corresponding public health lockdowns further heightened the "crisis" around the known gap in osteoporosis care and altered the provision of care (e.g., useof telehealth and initiation of treatment). Osteoporosis has a known substantial care and management disparity, which has been classified as a crisis. TheCOVID-19 pandemic created additional burden on osteoporosis patient care withhealthcare encounters, physician visits, diagnostic and laboratory tests, andtreatment initiations all declining during the initial pandemic period, relative to previous years.

AB  - Fragility fractures (i.e., low-energy fractures) account for most fractures amongolder Canadians and are associated with significant increases in morbidity andmortality. Study results suggest that low-energy fracture rates (associated with surgical intervention and outcomes) declined slightly, but largely remainedstable in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE/INTRODUCTION:This study describes rates of low-energy fractures, time-to-surgery,complications, and deaths post-surgery in patients with fractures during thecoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Alberta, Canada, compared to the threeyears prior. METHODS: A repeated cross-sectional study was conducted usingprovincial-level administrative health data. Outcomes were assessed in 3-monthperiods in the 3 years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and in the first two3-month periods after restrictions were implemented. Patterns of fracture- andhospital-related outcomes over the control years (2017-2019) and COVID-19restrictions periods (2020) were calculated. RESULTS: Relative to the averagefrom the control periods, there was a slight decrease in the absolute number oflow-energy fractures (n = 4733 versus n = 4308) during the first COVID-19 period,followed by a slight rise in the second COVID-19 period (n = 4520 versus n =4831). While the absolute number of patients with low-energy fractures receiving surgery within the same episode of care decreased slightly during the COVID-19periods, the proportion receiving surgery and the proportion receiving surgerywithin 24 h of admission remained stable. Across all periods, hip fracturesaccounted for the majority of patients with low-energy fractures receivingsurgery (range: 58.9-64.2%). Patients with complications following surgery andin-hospital deaths following fracture repair decreased slightly during theCOVID-19 periods. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that low-energy fracturerates, associated surgeries, and surgical outcomes declined slightly, but largelyremained stable in the first few months of the pandemic. Further investigation iswarranted to explore patterns during subsequent COVID-19 waves when thehealthcare system experienced severe strain.

TI  - Absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in ex vivo cultured cornea andcornea-derived epithelial cells.
LID - 10.1007/s00417-022-05776-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human corneal cells andtissues under standard corneal culture conditions using explants of COVID-19donors and primary cornea-derived epithelial cells. METHODS: Cornea isolated fromdeceased COVID-19 donors was cultured for 4 weeks, and SARS-CoV-2 replication wasmonitored by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, primary corneal epithelial cells from healthy donors were cultured ex vivo and infected with SARS-CoV-2 and humancytomegalovirus (HCMV) as a control. Infection status was assessed by westernblotting and reporter gene expression using green fluorescent protein-expressing viral strains. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor expression levels in cornea andepithelial cells were assessed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 replication in 10 corneas isolated from deceased COVID-19 patients and culturedfor 4 weeks, indicating absence of infection under natural conditions.Furthermore, high-titer SARS-CoV-2 infection of ex vivo cultured cornea-derivedepithelial cells did not result in productive virus replication. In contrast, thesame cells were highly permissive for HCMV. This phenotype could potentially beexplained by low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcriptional activity in cornea andcornea-derived epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that cornea andlimbal epithelial cells are refractory to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thiscould be due to the absence of robust receptor expression levels necessary forviral entry. This study adds further evidence to support the very low possibilityof transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected corneal transplant donor to arecipient in corneal organ cultures.

LID - 10.3290/j.ohpd.b3276187 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study compared the success of dental students with flippedclassroom and traditional classroom learning in the restorative dentistry course for the first time at the Faculty of Dentistry of Reims during the 2019- 2020academic year, influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic, and analysed the correlation with students' feelings. The use of an active learning method can improve successduring final exams and increase the motivation of students. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: The same teacher taught half of the restorative dentistry course in the flipped classroom approach and the other half as traditional classroom. For theflipped classroom, students were required to complete their homework onlinebefore the face-to-face sessions. An exam at the beginning and the end of thesemester was conducted with questions about concepts learned with each learningmethod. Statistical analysis was performed using a t-test at the 0.05significance level. A questionnaire on satisfaction was conducted to determinethe students' opinion on this new learning method in the flipped classroomcompared to the traditional classroom. RESULTS: The flipped classroom learningmethod enabled students to achieve better results on the final exam, with astatistically significant difference compared to traditional classroom learning. Student responses to the satisfaction questionnaire showed an increase inmotivation and interest in the lessons and correspond to the increase in examsuccess. CONCLUSION: The use of the flipped classroom for lower cognitive-levelactivities is more appreciated by students and yields better results thanknowledge acquisition in the traditional classroom.

AB  - Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higherconcentrations of SARS- CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Inthis retrospective study we considered different categories of patients definedas "vulnerable" because affected by other pathologies, such as patients withgenetic and cardiovascular diseases; patients with autoimmune dermatological dis-ease; kidney and lung transplant patients, and pregnant women because theprevalence of Covid-19 infection during pregnancy is not known. This study wasperformed at IRCCS San Matteo Hospital in Pavia, North Italy, a zone consideredat high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic from June to December 2020. None of thepositive screened patients had symptoms of COVID-19 infection at the time ofinclusion in this study.

PG  - 181-189
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women may be at an increased risk of developing severe orcritical disease associated with the Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing severities during pregnancy. Weperformed a prospective study to describe the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection onpregnancy outcomes and on the newborn, depending on the severity of the disease. The antibody response and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike (S) IgG, IgA andanti-Nu- cleocapsid (NCP) IgG, was investigated. METHODS: A total of 48 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled, and sequential serum samples from 30 of them were collected until one year after infection. Outcomes of pregnan- cyand newborn parameters were evaluated in comparison with 200 uninfected controls.RESULTS: Asymptomatic infection was observed in 31/48 women (64.5%), mildCOVID-19 in 12/48 women (25.0%), while 5/48 women (10.5%) developed pneumonia.Women with pneumonia mount- ed significantly higher levels of anti-S IgG, IgA andanti-NCP IgG between 1 and 3 months after onset of infection compared toasymptomatic women. Anti-S IgG persisted in the majority of women from 6 monthsto at least one year after infection, especially in those with symptomaticinfection and pneumonia, while anti-S IgA and anti-NCP IgG declined earlier.Pregnancy complications and new- born parameters were not significantly differentfrom those observed in uninfected controls. CONCLUSION: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody development and persistence was not impaired in pregnant women, while SARS-CoV-2 infection did not cause major pregnancy or newborn complications in asymptomatic or symptomatic women, nor in women with pneumonia receiving prompt clinical care.

How- ever, conventional test methods (RT-PCR and RapidAntigen) have weaknesses in test efficiency. Specific High sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter un-LOCKing (SHERLOCK), is a new technology that can detect nucleic acidseven with limited sample preparation, but with high sensitivity, high spec-ificity, rapidly, and flexibly. The key to the specificity of the SHERLOCKdiagnostic method is the single guide RNA (sgRNA). The purpose of this study was to analyze the design of the SHERLOCK sgRNA, which has optimum potential to beused as a Cas13a marker to recognize the spike protein gene of the ReceptorBinding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 strain from Indonesia. The method used was anin-silico approach using genomic and proteomic data and molecular docking. Thisstudy used a sample of 37 genomic data representing 86 types of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations in Indonesia. Based on the docking candidate results, sgRNA8has the lowest energy to bind to the viral protospacer target SARS-CoV-2 and ahigh melting point value at 70.3 degrees C, indicating that the sgRNA8 chain isthe optimal candidate for sgRNA.

TI  - Noninferiority of Subcutaneous Versus Intravenous Casirivimab/Imdevimab forOutpatient Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in a Real-World Setting.
LID - 10.1089/mab.2022.0008 [doi]
AB  - Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has emerged as one of the mainstay treatmentoptions for SARS-CoV-2. To improve speed of delivery and decrease bedside nursingneeds, subcutaneous (SC) delivery of mAbs has been explored as an alternative to standard intravenous (IV) administration. To date, data regarding theeffectiveness of SC compared with IV mAb are lacking. This retrospective cohortanalysis conducted between April 2021 and August 2021 compared hospitalizationrates among patients receiving IV versus SC administration ofcasirivimab/imdevimab (Regen-COV) at a single institution in Arkansas.Casirivimab/imdevimab was a promising mAb therapy utilized during the height ofthe Delta variant surge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Before resistance developedby the Omicron variant, casirivimab/imdevimab was utilized for outpatienttreatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients at risk of deterioration. Primary outcomes ofthis investigation were the 30-day post-treatment rate of hospitalization andintensive care unit (ICU) care during hospitalization. There was no increasedrisk of hospitalization or ICU care with SC administration compared with IVadministration. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate into variants such as Omicronand develop resistance to existing mAbs, these preliminary findings ofnoninferiority of SC versus IV warrant ongoing investigation into SCadministration of other mAbs.

TI  - [Spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 in Cologne and associatedsocio-economic factors in the period from February 2020 to October 2021].
LID - 10.1007/s00103-022-03573-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND GOALS: Even in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, whichtook a very different course globally, there were indications that socio-economicfactors influenced the dynamics of disease spread, which from the second phase(September 2020) onwards particularly affected people with a lower socio-economicstatus. Such effects can also be seen within a large city. The present studyvisualizes and examines the spatio-temporal spread of all COVID-19 cases reportedin Cologne, Germany (February 2020-October 2021) at district level and theirpossible association with socio-economic factors. METHODS: Pseudonymized data of all COVID-19 cases reported in Cologne were geo-coded and their distribution was mapped in an age-standardized way at district level over four periods andcompared with the distribution of social factors. The possible influence of theselected factors was also examined in a regression analysis in a model with case growth rates. RESULTS: The small-scale local infection process changed during thepandemic. Neighborhoods with weaker socio-economic indices showed higherincidence over a large part of the pandemic course, with a positive correlationbetween poverty risk factors and age-standardized incidence. The strength of thiscorrelation changed over time. CONCLUSION: The timely observation and analysis ofthe local spread dynamics reveals the positive correlation of disadvantagingsocio-economic factors on the incidence rate of COVID-19at the level of a largecity and can help steer local containment measures in a targeted manner.

TI  - Changes in cardiac structure and function from 3 to 12 months afterhospitalization for COVID-19.
LID - 10.1002/clc.23891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac function may be impaired during and early afterhospitalization for COVID-19, but little is known about the progression ofcardiac dysfunction and the association with postacute COVID syndrome (PACS).METHODS: In a multicenter prospective cohort study, patients who had beenhospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled and comprehensive echocardiography wasperformed 3 and 12 months after discharge. Twenty-four-hour electrocardiogram(ECG) was performed at 3 and 12 months in patients with arrhythmias at 3 months. RESULTS: In total, 182 participants attended the 3 and 12 months visits (age 58+/- 14 years, 59% male, body mass index 28.2 +/- 4.2 kg/m(2) ). Of these, 35(20%) had severe COVID-19 (treatment in the intensive care unit) and 74 (52%) hadself-reported dyspnea at 3 months. From 3 to 12 months there were no significant overall changes in any measures of left or right ventricle (LV; RV) structure andfunction (p > .05 for all), including RV strain (from 26.2 +/- 3.9% to 26.5 +/-3.1%, p = .29) and LV global longitudinal strain (from 19.2 +/- 2.3% to 19.3 +/- 2.3%, p = .64). Changes in echocardiographic parameters from 3 to 12 months didnot differ by COVID-19 severity or by the presence of persistent dyspnea (p > .05for all). Among patients with arrhythmia at 3 months, there was no significantchange in arrhythmia burden to 12 months. CONCLUSION: Following COVID-19, cardiacstructure and function remained unchanged from 3 to 12 months after the indexhospitalization, irrespective of COVID-19 severity and presence of persistentdyspnea. These results suggest that progression of cardiac dysfunction afterCOVID-19 is rare and unlikely to play an important role in PACS.

TI  - Multilevel Factors Associated with Obesity among South Korean Adolescents before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.1089/chi.2022.0053 [doi]
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-necessitated lockdowns and schoolclosures have limited social interactions among adolescents, which result inunhealthy behaviors. This study compared the multilevel factors associated withobesity among adolescents in South Korea before and during the pandemic. Method: We applied the social-ecological model and analyzed the 2019 and 2020 Korea YouthRisk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS), including middle and high schoolstudents. We considered factors at the individual, family, and community levelsin the logistic regression. Age and gender-adjusted obesity (body mass index >/= the 95th percentile) was the dependent variable. Result: The prevalence ofobesity slightly increased from 11.31% before the pandemic to 12.48% during it;the odds of obesity were 1.12 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.16) ashigh during the pandemic compared to before it. Several individual factors (e.g.,age, gender, fast-food consumption) and perceived family economic status werecommonly associated with obesity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Physical activity and city type were related to obesity only before the pandemic.Downgraded economic status owing to COVID-19 was adversely related to obesityduring the pandemic. Conclusion: Inclusive multilevel support is needed to combatobesity in adolescence during the pandemic and those economically impactedrequire additional support.

TI  - Meta-analysis of the microbial biomarkers in the gut - lung crosstalk inCOVID-19, community acquired pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infections.
LID - 10.1111/lam.13798 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory infections are the leading causes of mortality and the currentpandemic COVID-19 is one such trauma that imposed catastrophic devastation to thehealth and economy of the world. Unraveling the correlations and interplay of thehuman microbiota in the gut- lung axis would offer incredible solutions to theunderlying mystery of the disease progression. The study compared the microbiota profiles of six samples namely healthy gut, healthy lung, COVID-19 infected gut, COVID-19 infected lungs, Clostridium difficile infected gut and communityacquired pneumonia infected lungs. The metagenome datasets were processed,normalized, classified and the rarefaction curves were plotted. The microbialbiomarkers for COVID-19 infections were identified as the abundance of Candidaand Escherichia in lungs with Ruminococcus in the gut. Candida and Staphylococcuscould play a vital role as putative prognostic biomarkers of community acquiredpneumonia whereas abundance of Faecalibacterium and Clostridium are associatedwith the Clostridium difficile infections in gut. A machine learning randomforest classifier applied to the datasets efficiently classified the biomarkers. The study offers an extensive and incredible understanding of the existence ofgut lung axis during dysbiosis of two anatomically different organs.

TI  - When Pandemic Interferes with Work: Psychological Capital and Mental Health ofSocial Workers during COVID-19.
LID - swac035 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/sw/swac035 [doi]
AB  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is not only limited to physical health butalso extends to various aspects of everyday life. The present study proposes thatthe prolonged pandemic can lead to pandemic-work conflict (PWC). The articleexamines how the pandemic interferes with work, the association between PWC andmental health, and the underlying mechanism of this process. A total of 303full-time social workers in Hong Kong responded to measures on PWC, psychologicalcapital (PsyCap), and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Data were collectedbetween February and April 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was beginning toworsen; 15.8 percent and 14.9 percent of the participants reported mild to severeanxiety and depression, respectively. Time-based PWC was positively associatedand strain-based PWC was negatively associated with PsyCap, which was in turnnegatively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. PsyCap was asignificant mediator of these relationships. The findings suggest that therelationship between strain-based PWC and psychological distress can be explainedby PsyCap, whereby the depletion of psychological resources may contribute toanxiety and depressive symptoms. Positive psychological resources may be anintervening point for promoting mental health among the social servicesworkforce.

TI  - New-Onset IgA nephropathy Following COVID-19 Vaccination.
LID - hcac185 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcac185 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused significant economic and health damage worldwide. Rapid vaccination is one of the key strategies tocurb severe illness and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hundreds of millionsof people worldwide have received various COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNAvaccines, inactivated vaccines, and adenovirus-vectored vaccines, but the sideeffects and efficacy of most vaccines have not been extensively studied.Recently, there have been increasing reports of immunoglobulin A nephropathy(IgAN) after COVID-19 vaccination, however, whether their relationship is causal or coincidental remains to be verified. Here, we summarize the latest clinicalevidence of IgAN diagnosed by renal biopsy associated with the COVID-19 vaccinepublished by July 10, 2022 with the largest sample size, and propose a hypothesisfor the pathogenesis between them. At the same time, the new opportunitypresented by COVID-19 vaccine allows us to explore the mechanism of IgANrecurrence for the first time. Indeed, we recognize that large-scale COVID-19vaccination has enormous benefits in preventing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.The purpose of this review is to help guide the clinical assessment andmanagement of IgA nephropathy post COVID-19 vaccination and to enrich the"multi-hit" theory of IgA nephropathy.

TI  - Impaired physical function in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies:results from the multicentre COVAD patient-reported e-survey.
LID - keac441 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keac441 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The assessment of physical function is fundamental in the management of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). We aimed toinvestigate the physical function of patients with IIMs compared with those with non-IIM autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) utilizing Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (PF) data obtained inthe COVAD study, an international self-reported e-survey assessing the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in AIRDs. METHODS: Demographics, AIRD diagnosis, diseaseactivity, and PROMIS PF short form-10a data were extracted from the COVADdatabase. PROMIS PF-10a scores were compared between disease categories andstratified by disease activity. Factors affecting PROMIS PF-10a scores other thandisease activity were identified by multivariable regression analysis in patientswith inactive disease. RESULTS: 1057 IIM patients, 3635 non-IIM AIRD patients,and 3981 healthy controls (HCs) responded to the COVAD e-survey from April toAugust 2021. Using a binomial regression model, the predicted mean of PROMISPF-10a scores was significantly lower in IIM patients compared with non-IIM AIRD patients or HCs (36.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 35.5-37.1] vs 41.3 [95%CI40.2-42.5] vs 46.2 [95%CI 45.8-46.6], P < 0.001), irrespective of diseaseactivity. The independent factors for lower PROMIS PF-10a scores in patients withinactive disease were older age, female, longer disease duration, and a diagnosisof inclusion body myositis or polymyositis. CONCLUSION: Physical function issignificantly impaired in IIMs compared with non-IIM AIRDs or HCs, even inpatients with inactive disease. Our study highlights a critical need for betterstrategies to minimize functional disability in patients with IIMs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for adolescentswith juvenile-onset inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) is unknown. Severalstudies suggested attenuated immunogenicity in patients with IRD. This studyevaluated the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in preventingCOVID-19 infection in adolescents with juvenile-onset IRD compared with controls without immune rheumatic disease. METHODS: We used data from Clalit HealthServices, the largest healthcare organization in Israel, to conduct anobservational cohort study from February to December 2021, involving adolescents 12-18 years-old, diagnosed with IRD. Study outcomes included documented COVID-19 infection in relation to vaccination status and immunomodulatory therapy. Weestimated vaccine effectiveness as one minus the risk ratio. Adolescents without immune rheumatic disease, 12-18 years-old, served as controls. RESULTS: A totalof 1,639 adolescents with IRD (juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupuserythematosus, or familial Mediterranean fever) were included and compared with524 471 adolescents in the same age range. There was no difference in COVID-19infection rates after the second dose of vaccine for those with IRD and controls (2.1% vs 2.1% respectively, p= 0.99). The estimated vaccine effectiveness foradolescents with IRD was 76.3% after the first dose, 94.8% after the second and99.2% after the third dose. CONCLUSION: We found that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccineis effective against COVID-19 infection in adolescents with IRD, similar tocontrols without immune rheumatic disease. Immunomodulatory therapy did notaffect its effectiveness. These results can encourage adolescents with IRD to getvaccinated against COVID-19.

LID - 10.1080/01634372.2022.2107135 [doi]
AB  - While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older people has been recognized,there is limited understanding of its impact on older trans and gender diversepeople who often have different experiences of care and support than the general population. This article examines older trans and gender diverse people'sexperience of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a comparativemixed method survey administered in Australia and the United Kingdom. Using anon-probability sample of 84 participants who were connected to social media and service organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia, we found somecommonalities and differences between experiences in these countries. Someparticipants were isolated, including almost 1 in 5 participants who said thatthey did not have someone they could call upon in an emergency. However,participants had rich networks of friends, partners, and family members.Religious organizations and the community also played an important role. Friends were reported as the main emergency contacts and as the main people to whomsupport is provided. This research supports previous findings that friends oftrans and gender diverse people play an important role in well-being.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate Covid-19-associated risk of hospitalization and death in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis(PsA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) incomparison with the general population during pandemic's first year and comparetheir overall mortality with 2019. METHODS: Interlinking nation-wide electronicregistries, we recorded confirmed Covid-19-associated infections,hospitalizations and deaths, and all-cause deaths between 1-March-2020 and28-February-2021 in all adults with RA, AS, PsA, SLE, and SSc under treatment (n = 74 970, median age 67.5, 51.2, 58.1, 56.2, 62.2 years, respectively) and inmatched (1:5) on age, sex, and region of domicile random comparators from thegeneral population. Deaths from all causes during 2019 were also recorded.RESULTS: Compared with the general population incidence rates (IR) forCovid-19-associated hospitalization were higher in RA [IR ratio(IRR):1.71(1.50-1.95)], SLE [2.0(1.4-2.7)] and SSc [2.28(1.29-3.90)], whileCovid-19-associated death rates were higher in RA [1.91(1.46-2.49)]. Whenfocusing only on SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, after adjusting for age andgender, the odds ratio for Covid-19 associated death was higher in RA [1.47(1.11-1.94)] and SSc [2.92(1.07-7.99)] compared with the general population. All-cause mortality rate compared with the general population increased in RA during thefirst pandemic year (IRR : 0.71) with reference to 2019 (0.59) and decreased inSSc (IRR : 1.94 vs 4.36). CONCLUSION: Covid-19 may have more severe impact inpatients with systemic rheumatic disease than the general population.Covid-19-related mortality is increased in subgroups of patients with specificrheumatic diseases, underscoring the need for priority vaccination and access to targeted treatments.

AB  - With the success of COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials, vaccination programsare being administered for the population with the hopes of herd immunity.However, the success of any vaccination program depends on the percentage ofpeople willing to get vaccination which is influenced by social, economic,demographic, and vaccine-specific factors. Thus, it is important to understandpublic attitudes and perceptions toward vaccination. This study aims to measurepublic attitude toward vaccines and vaccinations before and during the COVID-19pandemic, using public data from Twitter. A total of 880,586 tweets for 57,529unique users were included in the study. Most of the tweets were posted in fivelanguages: French, English, Swedish, Dutch, and Italian. These tweets weredivided into two time periods: before COVID-19 (T1) and during COVID-19 (T2).This study observed the shift in the sentiments of the public attitude towardvaccines before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Both positive and negative shiftsin sentiments were observed for the users of various languages but shifts toward positive sentiments were more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Influenza vaccination coverage among health-care workers during the COVID-19epidemic in 2020/2021 influenza season: Evidence from a web-based survey innorthwestern China.
PG  - 2102354
LID - 10.1080/21645515.2022.2102354 [doi]
AB  - Vaccinating health-care workers against influenza during the COVID-19 pandemiccan effectively prevent and control influenza and reduce COVID-19 strain onhealth systems. This study was conducted to explore influenza vaccinationcoverage and determinants among health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020/2021 influenza season in Ningxia. This cross-sectional survey includeddemographic characteristics of health-care workers, influenza vaccination status,reasons for not getting vaccinated, and whether influenza vaccination wasrecommended for others. We found that influenza vaccine rate of health-careworkers was 39.6%. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that health-care workers' vaccination coverage was higher when the individuals were aware of theeffect of the influenza vaccine (OR = 0.624, 95% CI: 0.486-0.802). Health-careworkers who from internal medicine (OR = 1.494, 95% CI: 1.146-1.948), pediatrics (OR = 2.091, 95% CI: 1.476-2.962), and surgery departments (OR = 1.373, 95% CI:1.014-1.859) had a lower coverage than those who worked in vaccination andinfectious disease departments. The main reasons that some stated for not gettingvaccinated were that they felt it was unnecessary (52.22%). Health-care workerswho were vaccinated against influenza were more likely to recommend influenzavaccination to their patients than health-care workers who had not beenvaccinated. The incidence of influenza among health-care workers was higher than that of the general population in Ningxia. Under the policy of voluntary andself-pay influenza vaccination in Ningxia, the coverage rate of influenza vaccineamong health-care workers was far below the vaccination requirements of influenzavaccine in influenza season even during the COVID-19 epidemic.

TI  - Interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake: a scoping review.
PG  - CD015270
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD015270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID-19, a disease forwhich few treatments are available and which can lead to disability or death.Widespread vaccination against COVID-19 may help protect those not yet able toget vaccinated. In addition, new and vaccine-resistant mutations of SARS-CoV-2may be less likely to develop if the spread of COVID-19 is limited. Differentvaccines are now widely available in many settings. However, vaccine hesitancy isa serious threat to the goal of nationwide vaccination in many countries andposes a substantial threat to population health. This scoping review mapsinterventions aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake and decreasing COVID-19vaccine hesitancy. OBJECTIVES: To scope the existing research landscape oninterventions to enhance the willingness of different populations to bevaccinated against COVID-19, increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake, or decreaseCOVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and to map the evidence according to addressedpopulations and intervention categories. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CochraneCOVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded andEmerging Sources Citation Index), WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirusdisease, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to 11 October 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We includedstudies that assess the impact of interventions implemented to enhance thewillingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID-19, increase vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We included randomisedcontrolled trials (RCTs), non-randomised studies of intervention (NRSIs),observational studies and case studies with more than 100 participants.Furthermore, we included systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We did not limitthe scope of the review to a specific population or to specific outcomesassessed. We excluded interventions addressing hesitancy towards vaccines fordiseases other than COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were analysedaccording to a protocol uploaded to the Open Science Framework. We used aninteractive scoping map to visualise the results of our scoping review. We mappedthe identified interventions according to pre-specified intervention categories, that were adapted to better fit the evidence. The intervention categories were:communication interventions, policy interventions, educational interventions,incentives (both financial and non-financial), interventions to improve access,and multidimensional interventions. The study outcomes were also included in the mapping. Furthermore, we mapped the country in which the study was conducted, theaddressed population, and whether the design was randomised-controlled or not.MAIN RESULTS: We included 96 studies in the scoping review, 35 of which areongoing and 61 studies with published results. We did not identify any relevantsystematic reviews. For an overview, please seethehttps://egmopenaccess.3ieimpact.org/evidence-maps/interventions-increase-covid-19-vaccine-uptake?type=sharehttps://egmopenaccess.3ieimpact.org/evidence-maps/interventions-increase-covid-19-vaccine-uptake?type=share. Studies with published results Of the 61 studies withpublished results, 46 studies were RCTs and 15 NRSIs. The interventionsinvestigated in the studies were heterogeneous with most studies testingcommunication strategies to enhance COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Most studiesassessed the willingness to get vaccinated as an outcome. The majority of studieswere conducted in English-speaking high-income countries. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. Populations that wereaddressed were diverse. For example, studies targeted healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, at-risk patients, or the generalpopulation. Ongoing studies Of the 35 ongoing studies, 29 studies are RCTs andsix NRSIs. Educational and communication interventions were the most used typesof interventions. The majority of ongoing studies plan to assess vaccine uptakeas an outcome. Again, the majority of studies are being conducted inEnglish-speaking high-income countries. In contrast to the studies with publishedresults, most ongoing studies will not be conducted online. Addressed populationsrange from minority populations in the USA to healthcare workers or students.Eleven ongoing studies have estimated completion dates in 2022. AUTHORS'CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify and map a variety of heterogeneousinterventions for increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake or decreasing vaccinehesitancy. Our results demonstrate that this is an active field of research with 61 published studies and 35 studies still ongoing. This review gives acomprehensive overview of interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake andcan be the foundation for subsequent systematic reviews on the effectiveness ofinterventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. A research gap was shown forstudies conducted in low and middle-income countries and studies investigatingpolicy interventions and improved access, as well as for interventions addressingchildren and adolescents. As COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available,these populations and interventions should not be neglected in research.

TI  - International evidence to inform decision making on implementing urgent response social protection measures.
PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1080/13548506.2022.2108088 [doi]
AB  - This paper summarises evidence from a rapid review of international findings onthe effects of cash transfers. The learnings were used to inform the design ofurgent response social protection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The summarydemonstrates that in response to widespread disruption, cash transfers have broadbenefits for children, adults, and the wider economy. First, cash grants forchild support have been shown to reduce hunger, increase dietary diversity, andreduce secondary school dropout. Transfers may also reduce child malnutrition.Second, there is some evidence that cash grants could encourage job search andeconomic activity. By contrast, there is little evidence that grants discourageadults from working, or increase spending on temptation goods (alcohol, tobacco).Third, for the wider economy, there is little evidence that grants will increase inflation, while some studies find that transfers create a fiscal multiplier and stimulate the local economy. Finally, we review evidence on design considerationsand find that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) are particularly well suited torapid response when compared to conditional cash transfers (CCTs). Outside crisissettings, there is some evidence that getting recipients to enrol children inschool or attend health check-ups improves these outcomes more than unconditionalgrants. However, the differences are small and the additional costs ofimplementing conditions outweigh these benefits in circumstances where responseis required urgently. Comparing evidence on cash grants and food voucherssuggests both achieve similar improvements in nutrition; however, cash transfers are likely to be more cost-effective for governments, especially where a systemto distribute grants is already set up.

AB  - Climate change and population growth will increase vulnerability to natural andhuman-made disasters or pandemics. Longitudinal research studies may be adverselyimpacted by a lack of access to study resources, inability to travel around theurban environment, reluctance of sample members to attend appointments, samplemembers moving residence and potentially also the destruction of researchfacilities. One of the key advantages of longitudinal research is the ability to assess associations between exposures and outcomes by limiting the influence ofsample selection bias. However, ensuring the validity and reliability of findingsin longitudinal research requires the recruitment and retention of respondentswho are willing and able to be repeatedly assessed over an extended period oftime. This study examined recruitment and retention strategies of 11 longitudinalcohort studies operating during the Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake sequencewhich began in September 2010, including staff perceptions of the majorimpediments to study operations during/after the earthquakes and respondents'barriers to participation. Successful strategies to assist recruitment andretention after a natural disaster are discussed. With the current COVID-19pandemic, longitudinal studies are potentially encountering some of the issueshighlighted in this paper including: closure of facilities, restricted movementof research staff and sample members, and reluctance of sample members to attend appointments. It is possible that suggestions in this paper may be implemented sothat longitudinal studies can protect the operation of their research programmes.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionate effects on people living in low- andmiddle-income countries (LMICs), exacerbating weak health systems. We conducted ascoping review to identify, map, and synthesise studies in LMICs that measuredthe impact of COVID-19 on demand for, provision of, and access to contraceptiveand abortion-related services, and reproductive outcomes of these impacts. Using a pre-established protocol, we searched bibliographic databases (December2019-February 2021) and key grey literature sources (December 2019-April 2021).Of 71 studies included, the majority (61%) were not peer-reviewed, and 42% werebased in Africa, 35% in Asia, 17% were multi-region, and 6% were in Latin Americaand the Caribbean. Most studies were based on data through June 2020. Themagnitude of contraceptive service-related impacts varied widely across 55studies (24 of which also included information on abortion). Nearly all studiesassessing changes over time to contraceptive service provision noted declines of varying magnitude, but severe disruptions were relatively uncommon or of limited duration. Twenty-six studies addressed the impacts of COVID-19 on abortion andpostabortion care (PAC). Overall, studies found increases in demand, reductionsin provision and increases in barriers to accessing these services. The use ofabortion services declined, but the use of PAC was more mixed with some studiesfinding increases compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. The impacts of COVID-19 variedsubstantially, including the country context, health service, and populationstudied. Continued monitoring is needed to assess impacts on these key healthservices, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.

TI  - Residential substance use treatment outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women:Distinct patterns for women enrolled before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12803 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Substance use among pregnant and postpartum women (PPW) is aserious public health concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated substanceuse among the general population including pregnant women, and disruptedoperations for substance use treatment centers. Little is known about theoutcomes of substance use treatment for PPW before and during the COVID-19pandemic. METHOD: Data from a longitudinal program evaluation were analyzed toexamine outcomes among 136 PPW participating in a residential SUD treatmentprogram, and to explore differences in treatment outcomes for women who enrolled in services before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were used totest the significance of change from treatment intake to 6-month post-intake onassessments of substance use, mental health symptoms, and functioning collectedto evaluate the Healthy Families Program (HFP), a comprehensive program for PPWlocated within a gender-specific SUD treatment facility in the United States.RESULTS: Results indicated that from treatment intake to follow-up assessment,clients self-reported statistically significant improvements in familyfunctioning and daily functioning as well as reduced days of substance use.Notably, the rate of treatment intakes declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. In separate analyses by subgroup, mental health indicators showed improvements only for clients engaged in treatment before the COVID-19 pandemic and not for clientsserved during the COVID-19 pandemic, but substance use decreased significantlyfor both pre-pandemic and pandemic enrollees. CONCLUSION: Specialized treatmentconsiderations and implications for PPW are discussed, including a need for addedemphasis on co-occurring mental health symptoms and family system stress during apandemic, and the role of nurses in identifying and addressing these concerns.Additionally, potential relapse prevention efforts during COVID-19 for PPW withsubstance use disorders are examined. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The present researchcontinues to highlight the importance of specialized treatment programming forPPW with SUDs as well as the potential need for additional recovery supportmechanisms to be utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - INDICATORS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN THE YOUTH.
PG  - 7-12
AB  - The rate of physical activity among young people worldwide has changed in recent decades. A sharp change in physical activity is observed in young people afterthey finish school and start studying at universities. This study showed the mainpatterns of the physical activity among the medical students in Georgia, as well as the effect of the global events. Incentive and inhibitory factors have alsobeen identified that significantly determine the rate of increase and decrease.The aim of the study was to assess the physical activity rates of students atTbilisi State Medical University. The physical activity level was studied byusing the self-reported assessment by means of the specially developedquestionnaire. The questionnaire was based on literary sources and expertopinion, and tested among peers. 34 questions covered demographic information(8), lifestyle and physical activity (16), exercising (5) and impact of COVID-19 (4). The survey through Google Forms was anonymous. Epidata 3.1 was used for dataentry. The data were analysed in Stata 14.0. Descriptive statistics was used togenerate frequencies, percentages and proportions. Where relevant, the Chi-squaretest was used to determine any statistical significance. Sampling frame consistedof the students of Tbilisi State Medical University. Respondents were chosen bythe cluster random sampling method. Random cluster sampling was used withconfidence interval/margin of error 10 and confidence level 95%. A total of 265students participated in the study (Faculty of Medicine - 63.77%, Faculty ofPublic Health - 35.4%; first-year students - 41.13%, fourth-year students -58.11%). More than 57.4% of the respondents consider themselves physicallypassive. 74.7% of them make less than 10,000 steps per day. 79.5% do not exerciseregularly. Students explain their low level of physical activity by variousreasons, such as COVID-19 pandemic (65.5%), smartphone use (56.6%), lack of free time (79.2%), lack of finances (40.8%) and motivation (54.3%). On the other hand,a relatively small proportion of respondents (30.6%) answered that they arephysically active. They go by foot (26.3%), make 6,000 to 10,000 steps a day(17.4%) and prefer taking stairs (57.5%). They engage in a variety of physicalactivities, such as: sports, football, basketball, gym and home gym, swimming,aqua aerobics, dancing, cycling and walking. This study is the first on thelifestyle and physical activity of young people in Georgia during the CovidPandemic. Trends related to the physical activity of students living in Georgiaare similar in different countries around the world. Young people have commonproblems, obstacles or incentives.

TI  - SLIDE: Saliva-Based SARS-CoV-2 Self-Testing with RT-LAMP in a Mobile Device.
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c01023 [doi]
AB  - Regular, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive self-testing for severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed to quellpandemic propagation. The existing at-home nucleic acid testing (NAT) test hashigh sensitivity and specificity, but it requires users to mail the sample to thecentral lab, which often takes 3-5 days to obtain the results. On the other hand,rapid antigen tests for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen provide a fast sample to answerthe test (15 min). However, the sensitivity of antigen tests is 30 to 40% lowerthan nucleic acid testing, which could miss a significant portion of infectedpatients. Here, we developed a fully integrated SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) device using a self-collectedsaliva sample. This platform can automatically handle the complexity and canperform the functions, including (1) virus particles' thermal lysis preparation, (2) sample dispensing, (3) target sequence RT-LAMP amplification, (4) real-timedetection, and (5) result report and communication. With a turnaround time ofless than 45 min, our device achieved the limit of detection (LoD) of 5copies/muL of the saliva sample, which is comparable with the LoD (6 copies/muL) using FDA-approved quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)assays with the same heat-lysis saliva sample preparation method. With clinicalsamples, our platform showed a good agreement with the results from thegold-standard RT-PCR method. These results show that our platform can performself-administrated SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing by laypersons with noninvasivesaliva samples. We believe that our self-testing platform will have an ongoingbenefit for COVID-19 control and fighting future pandemics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to investigate the percentage of professionals with an intention toleave Nursing during the COVID-10 pandemic, as well as the factors associatedwith this outcome. METHOD: a cross-sectional study conducted by applyingquestionnaires to 890 Nursing professionals from the municipality of Pelotas(RS). The outcome was identified by means of self-reports obtained from thequestion itself. Relative Risks, as well as their Confidence Intervals (95%),were calculated for the independent variables by means of unadjusted and adjustedPoisson regression. RESULTS: the percentage of professionals who stated theirintention to leave Nursing was 24.6% (n=219). There was a positive associationbetween the outcome and higher schooling levels, negative evaluation ofinstitutional support, moderate or intense overload, and skin lesions. A negativeassociation was also observed between the outcome and individuals aged 51 yearsold or more. CONCLUSION: except for skin lesions, aspects such as lack of supportand overload, although they may have been intensified during the pandemic, do notrepresent a new fact in the health services. In this sense, the associationsfound in the study reflect the need for cross-sectional actions to promoteretention of professionals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to analyze the relationship between the concern and fear of COVID-19with fatalism in the daily work of nurses. METHOD: analytical cross-sectionalstudy carried out with a total of 449 nurses. Data collection was performed usinginstruments validated in Peru. In the analysis, the Shapiro-Wilk test and theSpearman correlation coefficient were used, and two multiple regression modelswere estimated, with variable selection in stages. RESULTS: nurses had a moderatelevel of fatalism and a low level of fear and concern about COVID-19. The firststatistical model, which included sociodemographic variables, explains only 3% ofthe fatalism variance. However, a second model that includes fear and perception explains 33% of it. CONCLUSION: Worry, fear and having been diagnosed withCOVID-19 were predictors of fatalism. It is suggested the implementation ofpsycho-emotional interventions in daily work - aimed at Nursing professionals whopresent high levels of fear or concern - to reduce fatalism and prevent fatalconsequences of the pandemic and promote health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Respiratory Syndromes Surveillance System was created by theBrazilian Ministry of Health in 2000 to monitor influenza in this country. Withthe emergence of the new coronavirus pandemic, it became incorporated into thesurveillance network for influenza and other respiratory viruses. OBJECTIVE: Toanalyze the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the state of Acre through its hierarchical urbannetwork. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, descriptive and ecological study,using a spatiotemporal approach and using secondary data. This study wasconducted in the state of Acre, northern Brazil. METHODS: This study usedsecondary data, and epidemiological weeks and municipalities were taken to be theunits of analysis. Incidence rates and kernel intensities were calculated forfour study periods. Spatiotemporal analysis was performed using scan statisticsto identify clusters of SARS cases and considering the population of eachmunicipality. RESULTS: In general, it could be observed that there were higherkernel rates and intensities in municipalities located in the north and south of this state (i.e. its most populous municipalities). CONCLUSION: Priority areasfor interventions to control transmission of COVID-19 were highlighted, with the aim of reducing the risks of transmission to more distant areas in the urbanhierarchy of the state of Acre.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases amongasthmatics has been reported to be reduced. However, the findings regarding theassociation between asthma and the risk of severe COVID-19 have been divergent.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether asthma is associated with a reduced risk ofdevelopment of severe COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis onCOVID-19 surveillance databases at two tertiary-level hospitals in Sao Paulo,Brazil. METHODS: The medical records of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19between March and August 2020 were reviewed in accordance with the clinical,laboratorial, radiological and epidemiological criteria for COVID-19, and forcomorbidities. RESULTS: Among the adult patients included (> 18 years of age)there were 52 asthmatics and 1,318 non-asthmatics. Their median ages andinterquartile ranges (IQR) were, respectively, 54 (41-69) and 60 (44-72) years.At least one comorbidity was seen in 73% of asthmatics and 56% of thenon-asthmatics. Among the asthmatics, most presented mild asthma (92%) and theprevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was high (27%). Theasthmatics presented an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-19 of 0.89(95% confidence interval, CI 0.5-1.56); and OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.5 -1.68) aftermultivariable adjustment. Age > 60 years, male sex, hypertension, diabetes,cancer and homelessness were covariates associated with increased odds for severeCOVID-19. Kaplan-Meier estimated survival over hospitalization of up to 30 daysdid not differ between the groups (log-rank P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Theassociation between asthma and decreased risk of severe COVID-19 or increasedsurvival was statistically non-significant.

AB  - This study aimed to describe the management and results of the test event forevaluating relaxation of social distancing measures in Santa Catarina, Brazil.This is an experience report that described results of the test event carried outin July 2021 and for which the participants underwent real-time polymerase chain reaction diagnostic testing 72-48 hours before the event and had follow-up for 15days afterwards. The outcomes analyzed were SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 14 daysafter the event and presence of symptoms. Among 313 participants, the mean agewas 45.1 years and 54.3% were female. During follow-up, 7.7% (24) of thecontacted participants reported symptoms compatible with infection, but of the240 who attended post-event testing, none of the results detected the presence ofthe virus. No post-event COVID-19 cases were reported. We suggest that other testevents be carried out to evaluate the recommendations indicated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the Brazilian panorama of the training of nurses during theCOVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: a cross-sectional study, carried out with 335coordinators of undergraduate courses in Nursing and online data collection,between November 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: All Brazilian states wererepresented. Of Higher Education Institutions, 52.5% adopted remote learningwithin 10 days after determining social distancing and 23% after 100 days; 73.4% kept the students in a mandatory curricular internship. Practical classes had areduction in the number of students per group (46.0%). Most faculty and students were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 and showed worsening in mental health.CONCLUSIONS: The study identified heterogeneity in the resumption of activities, through remote teaching, which mostly occurred synchronously. There was aresumption of curricular internships and practical classes in health services,with a limitation on the number of students per field.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To build a theoretical model that represents the experience of family caregivers of elderly people during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Qualitativestudy that used the Grounded Theory as a methodology, carried out in Minas GeraisState in August 2020. 16 caregivers were interviewed. RESULTS: Uncomfortableemotions emerged and drove the caregivers' actions to: adopt preventive measures to protect the elderly from contracting the coronavirus; guarantee theirhealthcare; and make them aware of the pandemic. However, when these emotionsmanifested in an exacerbated manner, they needed to be alleviated so that theycould adopt such initiatives. CONCLUSION: The emotions felt by caregivers cancompromise their health and quality of life. Therefore, health professionals needto create strategies to ensure that they are well assisted, enabling care throughtelehealth. Guidance on the pandemic for caregivers could reflect better care forthe elderly people.

PG  - 1095-1099
LID - 10.14744/tjtes.2021.06777 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies amongchildren. In this retrospective clinical study, we attempted to determine theeffects of the COVID-19 pandemic period on hospital admission time and length of hospital stay (LOS) in pediatric appendicitis cases. METHODS: We retrospectively compared pediatric appendectomies from the date of the first reported COVID-19case to June 1, 2020, which is considered as the start of the normalizationprocess, with pre-pandemic pediatric appendectomies of the same number of days interms of age, gender, hospital admission time, LOS, parental educational level,laboratory values, and histopathological findings. RESULTS: There was an average increase of 2 days in the time from the onset of symptoms to hospital admissionin pediatric appen-dicitis patients in the COVID-19 period (p=0.001).Furthermore, C-reactive protein value was statistically significantly higher inthe COVID-19 period (p=0.018). Given the LOS, it was calculated as an average of 5 days in the pre-pandemic period and 4 days in the COVID-19 period, and thisdifference was statistically insignificant (p=0.273). There was no significantdifference between the groups in terms of histopathological findings (p=0.176).The parental educational level had no effect on the admission time. CONCLUSION:The hospital admission time of pediatric appendicitis patients is significantlyprolonged in the COVID-19 pandemic, but this prolongation had nohistopathological effect. During the pandemic, the recovery of patients whorequired urgent treatment during the 'stay-at-home' period was also negativelyaffected. Notwithstanding, we are of the opinion that the absence of an increase in the LOS may be due to the willingness of both families and physicians to keep the LOS as short as possible. Despite the increase in hospital admission time in pediatric appendicitis during the Covid 19 pandemic process, the lack of increasein the rate of complicated appendicitis may be an indicator of the importance of other factors in the development of complicated appendicitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)in patients with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Iran, where mostpatients receive corticosteroids and are at high risk for COVID-19 infection.METHOD: We collected the demographic, diagnostic, and treatment data of allCOVID-19 patients by the clinical COVID-19 registry system. We recruited 38 RApatients and 2216 non-RA patients from the COVID-19 registry. The primary outcomewas mortality due to COVID-19. We also studied the risk of intensive care unitadmission and intubation in RA patients compared to non-RA patients. We usedmultiple logistic regression analysis to study the association between RA and therisk of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULT: We recruited 38 RA patients and 2216 non-RApatients from the COVID-19 registry. The RA patients had a higher mean age (59.9 years) than the non-RA patients (57.7 years). The group of RA patients had alarger proportion of women (76.3%) than the non-RA patients (40.8%). The deathrate due to COVID-19 was significantly higher in RA patients than non-RA patients(odds ratio [OR] = 2.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-5.81). The OR washigher among those who received prednisolone than among those who did not (OR =3.59, 95% CI = 1.54-7.81). The odds of intubation were statistically significant among patients who received corticosteroid therapy (OR = 2.58, 95% CI =1.07-6.18). CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 outcomes was higher in RA patientsthan non-RA patients, especially for RA patients who received a low dose ofprednisolone. The results of this study can be used to triage RA patients who getinfected by COVID-19. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required tomore precisely define the high-risk groups.

LID - 10.1111/jjns.12507 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Temporary lodging facilities which were non-medical facilities wereestablished to secure beds for severely and moderately ill patients withCOVID-19, as well as for isolation, non-contact observation, and care of mildlyill and asymptomatic patients in Japan. This study aims to understand nursingmanagement practices adopted in these facilities by examining cases of theirestablishment and operation. METHODS: A multiple-case study design was used.Interviews for qualitative data collection were conducted from August to October 2020. After analyzing the nursing management practices in four temporary lodging facilities, common points were collated and integrated. RESULTS: For theestablishment and operation of temporary lodging facilities, a three-layerstructure based on disaster management methods was adopted: headquarters at thehelm as overseers, field supervisors in the middle, and frontline nursing staffat the base. The structure had clear roles, facilitated information exchange, andprovided efficient and effective nursing care. Field supervisors mainly provided psychological and clinical support for staff and served as information andinterprofessional hubs. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that temporary lodgingfacilities should be organized based on principles of the division of labor. The workforce should comprise nursing staff, and experienced nursing professionalsshould be recruited to the higher echelons.

TI  - The prevalence of positive patients to COVID-19 rapid nasopharyngeal antigentesting in private dental practices.
PG  - 206-211
LID - 10.23736/S2724-6329.22.04627-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A quick diagnosis is crucial in effectively limiting the spread ofSARS-CoV-2. The study aims to assess the prevalence of positive rapid tests inprivate dental practices. METHODS: This is an observational study. 532 COVID-19rapid nasopharyngeal antigen tests were carried out in the Veneto region ofItaly. Patients of 4 dental practices in different cities (Caorle, Montebelluna, Treviso and Vicenza) were screened with a rapid test (Rapid Test COVID-19 Agimmunochromatographic assay, Techno Genetics) throughout November and December2020. All the positive results from rapid tests were further investigated with a molecular test (PCR). All the patients tested showed no symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and had already undergone triage and temperaturemeasurement. In total 532 tests were taken: 202 in Caorle (Venice), 130 inMontebelluna (Treviso), 100 in Treviso, and 100 in Vicenza. Statistical analysis was carried with the computing environment R version 3.2.1 (R Foundation forStatistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). In particular, R was used for estimatingthe P value of the chi(2) test. The test was considered significant if the Pvalue was lower or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of the rapid tests thatresulted positive was 7.14% (38 out of 532 in total, 22 out of 202 in Caorle, 6out of 130 in Montebelluna, 4 out of 100 in Treviso and 6 out of 100 in Vicenza).Among these patients, 36 tested positive also with a molecular test (94.74%), in particular, 21 in Caorle, 5 in Montebelluna, 4 in Treviso, and 6 in Vicenza.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of positive patients screened with a rapid test inprivate dental practices stands at 7.14% and it was confirmed in most of thepatients with molecular tests. Therefore, in high-risk environments like dentalpractices, it is imperative to follow all the precautionary measures, and having every patient tested with a rapid test could be taken into consideration to limitthe spread of COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics and Pregnancy-Related Outcomes of Pregnant WomenHospitalized with COVID-19 During the Delta Wave: A Single-Center ObservationalStudy.
LID - 10.3947/ic.2022.0072 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy is associatedwith increased disease severity and an increased risk of perinatal complications.However, few studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 have been conducted inKorea. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical course andpregnancy outcomes of pregnant women admitted to our hospital with COVID-19according to the severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort studyincluded women aged 18 years of age or older who were hospitalized in the Gachon University Gil Medical Center with COVID-19 during pregnancy between July 1, 2021and January 31, 2022. COVID-19 severity was classified according to the "Criteriafor severity classification by symptoms of COVID-19" presented by the KoreaDisease Control and Prevention Agency. Severe cases were defined as those whorequired oxygen treatment administered via a high-flow nasal cannula or invasive mechanical ventilation or should be applied extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: A total of 103 pregnant women were hospitalized with COVID-19 during the study period. Their mean age was33 (+/- 4.14) years, and 4 (3.9%) had been vaccinated against COVID-19. At thetime of diagnosis of COVID-19, 3 (2.9%), 33 (32.0%), and 67 (65.1%) patients werein the first, second, and third trimester, respectively. The most common symptomswere cough (99 patients, 96.1%) and fever (85 patients, 82.5%). There was 1(1.0%) asymptomatic patient. Forty patients (38.8%) required supplemental oxygen and 19 patients (18.4%) had severe disease. Of the 19 severe cases, 7 were in the2nd trimester and 12 were in the 3rd trimester. Forty-one (39.8%) patientsdelivered, including two twin deliveries. Of the 41 cases of delivery, 14 werepremature, 4 out of 21 (19.0%) in mild, 4 out of 12 (25.0%) in moderate, and 6out of 8 (75.0%) in severe. Severe disease was associated with an increased rate of preterm birth (P = 0.012). Four of the 43 neonates (9.1%) received oxygentreatment. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with COVID-19 had a high rate of severedisease and a high preterm delivery rate, especially among those with severedisease.

TI  - A Transient Effect of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in a Patient with SevereCovonavirus Disease 2019: A Case Report.
LID - 10.3947/ic.2020.0089 [doi]
AB  - A 65-year-old male patient with an end-stage renal disease was diagnosed withcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by reverse transcription polymerase chainreaction. The patient complained of cough, sputum, and respiratory distress that worsened three days ago. The patient required mechanical ventilation andextracorporeal mentrane oxygenation. On day 9, convalescent plasma collected froma 34-year old man who recovered from COVID-19 45 days ago was administered. Thepatient showed immediate clinical improvement. However, on day 14, the patient's clinical course worsened again. On day 19 and day 24, vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus faecium bacteremia and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureuspneumonia were found. After long-term supportive care, he slowly recovered. Hewas discharged on day 91 without any oxygen requirement. This case reportsuggests that convalescent plasma therapy might just provide a short-term relief and that persistent effort for critical care is necessary to save patients fromsevere COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze in-hospital perioperative complications in COVID-19patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed medical records of 1.250 patientswith COVID-19 for the period from April 2020 to December 2021. Mean age ofpatients was 62.8+/-2.1 years, length of hospital-stay - 44.3+/-3.7 days. Allpatients received therapy in accordance with the national guidelines onprevention, diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection (COVID-19)>>(versions 1-12). Visualization of hematomas, arterial and venous thrombosis wasperformed using ultrasound, CT and CT angiography. RESULTS: Mortality rate was1.5%. Surgical complications included various hematomas, arterial and venousthrombosis of great vessels. Hematomas were detected in 15 (1.2%) patients, 2 of them died. There were hematomas of extremities in 5 cases, retroperitoneal space - 4, soft tissues of the body - 4, internal organs (spleen) -2 patients. Thevolume of hematoma was up to 100 ml in 6 patients, 100-500 ml in 5 patients,500-1000 ml in 3 patietns, more than 1000 ml in 1 patient. Hematomas occurred in 23.1+/-1.1 days after laboratory verification of COVID-19. Four (26.7%) patients underwent emergency surgery. Conservative therapy was followed by lysis ofhematoma after 25.1+/-2.7 days. Venous thrombosis without signs of flotationoccurred in 20 (1.6%) patients, arterial thrombosis - in 3 (0.24%) patients (2ones required surgery). CONCLUSION: Management of COVID-19 patients with various hematomas should be as conservative as possible. Arterial thrombosis andextensive spleen hematomas requiring surgical treatment are features of COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze treatment outcomes in patients with severe pseudomembranouscolitis and previous coronavirus infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Weretrospectively analyzed treatment outcomes, clinical, laboratory andhistological data in convalescents of COVID-19 who admitted to the department of coloproctology for moderate-to-severe pseudomembranous colitis confirmed byendoscopic examination between 2020 and 2021. RESULTS: There were 13 patientswith moderate pseudomembranous colitis and 6 ones with severe pseudomembranouscolitis. Mean period after recovery from coronavirus infection was 19 days.Endoscopy revealed whitish-yellow or gray raised plaques on colonic mucosa in allcases. Four patients with signs of peritonitis underwent emergency surgery. Threepatients had perforation of caecum; one patient had perforation of sigmoid colon and widespread peritonitis. Two patients underwent urgent surgery for progressivetoxic megacolon and ineffective therapy. Subtotal colectomy and ileostomy wereperformed in all cases. Histological examination revealed necrosis of not onlysuperficial layer of colon mucosa typical for clostridial colitis, but also theentire thickness of mucosa, as well as submucosal and partially muscular layersin some cases. Mucosal crypt atrophy, fibrinoid effusion in muscular layer,diffuse polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and necrosis of muscular andsubmucosal nerve plexuses, as well as necrosis of vascular walls with deposition of hyaline-like structures characterize microcirculatory ischemic processes inthe colon wall. CONCLUSION: Severe pseudomembranous colitis associated withCOVID-19 may not be associated with clostridial infection. Further analysis ofpossible ischemic etiology and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal lesions inCOVID-19 is needed for preventive and therapeutic measures.

PG  - 101161STROKEAHA122038955

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) secondary to vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia is an extremely rare side effect of adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccines. CVST incidence associated with COVID-19 itself has not beenwidely reported. We report the incidence of CVST in patients hospitalized withCOVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzedde-identified electronic medical records of a retrospective cohort of patientsadmitted with COVID-19 to >200 hospitals between March 2020 and March 2021. Weused International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes and naturallanguage processing extracts to identify patients with a new CVST diagnosisduring COVID-19 hospitalization. The primary outcome was CVST incidence inhospitalized, COVID-19-positive patients. Secondary outcomes included CVSTincidence and mortality. Incidence rates were calculated using theDerSimonian-Laird estimator method. RESULTS: Ninety-one thousand seven hundredtwenty-seven patients were evaluated; 22 had new CVST diagnoses by electronicmedical record review. CVST incidence in the hospitalized COVID-19 cohort was 231per 1 000 000 person-years (95% CI, 152.1-350.8). Females<50 had the highestincidence overall (males <50: 378.4 [142-1008.2]; females<50: 796.5[428.6-1480.4]). In patients >/=50 years old, males had a higher estimated CVSTincidence (males>/=50: 130.5 [54.3-313.6]; females>/=50: 88.8 [28.6-275.2]).Older patients (45.5% of patients >/=50 versus 0% of <50 years of age, P=0.012)and males (44.4% of males versus 7.7% of females, P=0.023) were more likely todie in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: CVST incidence in COVID-19-positive hospitalizedpatients is high. Advanced age and male gender were associated with likelihood ofdeath in hospital; further studies are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - This paper reports a presumptive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a cat. A cat with respiratory disease living with threeindividuals with coronavirus disease 2019 showed bilateral ground-glass opacitiesin the lung on X-ray and computed tomography. The clinical swabs were negativefor SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but the serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Interstitial pneumonia and prominent type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia were noted on histopathology. Respiratory tissues were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen, but the cat was positive for feline parvovirus DNA. In conclusion, therespiratory disease and associated pathology in this cat could have been due toexposure to SARS-CoV-2.

LID - 10.1002/jaba.950 [doi]
AB  - In 2020 the Centers for Disease Control provided the public with recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 by wearing a mask in the community. In the currentstudy, experimenters coached group home staff via telehealth to implementsynchronous schedules of reinforcement to increase mask wearing for 5 adults withintellectual and developmental disabilities. Results showed the interventioneffectively increased mask wearing for all participants for up to 30 min.Additionally, some participants for whom we assessed generalization of maskwearing demonstrated generalization to various community environments.Furthermore, procedural integrity data suggested staff could be coached viatelehealth to implement the intervention, and staff surveys suggested theprocedures and coaching were socially valid.

TI  - Chest multidetector computed tomography imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia patientswith hematologic malignancies.
LID - 10.5045/br.2022.2022085 [doi]
AB  - Background: Data on the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)and the epidemiology and outcomes of hematological malignancies are limited.Hence, the present study aimed to assess the imaging findings using chestmultidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with hematologicmalignancies who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective study included two groups, the first group consisted of COVID-19 infected patients withhematologic malignancies (100 patients), while the second group consisted ofCOVID-19 infected patients without hematologic malignancies or othercomorbidities (100 patients). The hematological malignancies included in thisstudy were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (40 patients), acute myeloid leukemia (25patients), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (15 patients), multiple myeloma (10patients), Hodgkin's lymphoma (8 patients), and myelodysplastic syndrome (2patients). Chest multidetector CT imaging was performed in all patients to assessfor ground-glass opacity, consolidation, pleural effusion, and airwayabnormalities. Results: More than one CT finding was reported in each patient. Nosignificant difference was observed in the ground-glass opacities (P=0.0594),nodule formation (P=0.2278), or airway thickening/dilatation (P=0.0566) betweenthe two groups; meanwhile, a significant difference was observed in the degree ofconsolidation, the number of lobes affected, and pleural effusion (P=0.0001) aswell as in the total lung severity (P=0.0001); minimal, mild, and severeaffection rates; and (P=0.0047) moderate affection rates. Conclusion: Early andreliable diagnosis of lung disease in COVID-19-infected patients may be achieved through multidetector CT imaging. Patients with hematological malignancies aremore likely to have severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and radiologists should recognize the CT characteristics of this infection.

TI  - Patients' and caregivers' experiences of hospitalization under COVID-19visitation restrictions.
LID - 10.1002/jhm.12924 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals did not allow caregivervisitation. Little is known about how caregivers' absence affected patients'care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe visitation restrictions' impact on patients and their caregivers experiences. DESIGN: We used a sequentialexplanatory mixed-methods study design. First, we randomly selected 200 adultpatients with cancer or heart failure hospitalized before (n = 100) and duringvisitor restrictions (n = 100) and abstracted data from the electronic medicalrecord on communication between medical teams and caregivers and the topicsdiscussed. Results from the quantitative analysis guided our thematic analysis ofsemi-structured interviews conducted with a subsample of patients hospitalizedduring visitor restrictions and their caregivers to understand the impact ofvisitor restrictions on their experiences. RESULTS: Compared to prerestrictions, caregivers under visitation restrictions communicated less frequently with themedical team (29% vs. 37% of hospitalized days; p = .04), fewer receiveddischarge counseling (37% vs. 52%; p = .04), and disproportionately more had nocontact with the medical team (36% vs. 17%; p < .01). Video conferencing wasdocumented for caregivers of only five patients. Qualitative analysis revealedthat both caregivers and patients experienced emotional distress, increasedconflict, and decreased perception of quality of care because of visitationrestrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital visitor restrictions significantly reducedcaregivers' communication with patients' medical team, causing caregivers andpatients emotional distress. Protocols that facilitate communication betweencaregivers and care teams may benefit caregivers who cannot be physically presentat care facilities, including distance caregivers.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 evolution and patient immunological history shape the breadth andpotency of antibody-mediated immunity.
LID - jiac332 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac332 [doi]
AB  - Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, humans have been exposed to distinctSARS-CoV-2 antigens, either by infection with different variants, and/orvaccination. Population immunity is thus highly heterogeneous, but the impact of such heterogeneity on the effectiveness and breadth of the antibody-mediatedresponse is unclear. We measured antibody-mediated neutralisation responsesagainst SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha, SARS-CoV-2delta and SARS-CoV-2omicronpseudoviruses using sera from patients with distinct immunological histories,including naive, vaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha orSARS-CoV-2delta, and vaccinated/infected individuals. We show that the breadthand potency of the antibody-mediated response is influenced by the number, thevariant, and the nature (infection or vaccination) of exposures, and thatindividuals with mixed immunity acquired by vaccination and natural exposureexhibit the broadest and most potent responses. Our results suggest that theinterplay between host immunity and SARS-CoV-2 evolution will shape theantigenicity and subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, with importantimplications for future vaccine design.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigates the hygiene standards in the context of theCOVID-19-pandemic and their impact on the perioperative incidence of hMPV as wellas the typical symptom burden of hMPV-infected children with congenital heartdefects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2018 and July 2021 all patients of a cardiac paediatric intensive care unit (cPICU) of a German university hospital were included in this retrospective cohort analysis. RESULTS: A total of 589patients with congenital heart disease were included in the analysis. 352patients (148 females and 204 males) were admitted before the introduction ofsocial distancing and face masks between March 2018 and April 15, 2020 (cohortA). 237 patients (118 females and 119 males) were admitted after the introductionbetween April 16 and July 2021 (cohort B). In cohort A, hMPV was detected in 11out of 352 patients (3.1 %) during their stay at cPICU. In cohort B, one patient out of 237 (0.4 %) tested positive for hMPV. Patients who tested positive forhMPV stayed in cPICU for a median of 17.5 days (range, 2 - 45 days). Patientswithout a detected hMPV-infection stayed in the cPICU for a median of 4 days(range, 0.5 - 114 days). 9 out of 12 (75 %) hMPV-positive patients showedatelectasis. CONCLUSION: Peri-operative hMPV infections prolong cPICU stay inpaediatric patients with congenital heart disease. In affected patients,pulmonary impairment with typical symptoms appears. Under certain circumstances, a complication-rich perioperative infection with hMPV could be prevented inpaediatric cardiac high-risk patients by prophylactic hygiene intervention.

AB  - This case involves a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and massive pulmonaryembolism requiring mechanical ventilation. His clinical course was complicated bydelirium likely triggered by his critical illness and failed initial extubation, isolation from family, and escalating fear and desperation. In hopefulpreparation for subsequent successful extubation, a unique approach was taken to decrease the risk of panic, delirium, and decompensation leading to reintubation.As a means of orienting him to his treatment pathway and to provide encouragementfor continued recovery, an impromptu patient-directed checklist was constructed. The recovery checklist, written in simplified language, outlined the stages ofsevere illness that the patient had overcome after his emergent intubation. Thelist also outlined the tasks he needed to complete prior to hospital discharge.Unexpectedly, the checklist received a great deal of engagement from both thepatient and medical team and played an important role in this patient'ssuccessful recovery and rehabilitation.

AB  - Zoonoses represent a global public health threat. Understanding lay perceptionsof risk associated with these diseases can better inform proportionate policyinterventions that mitigate their current and future impacts. While individualzoonoses (e.g. bovine spongiform encephalopathy) have received scientific andpublic attention, we know little about how multiple zoonotic diseases varyrelative to each other in lay risk perceptions. To this end, we examined publicperceptions of 11 zoonoses across 12 qualitative attributes of risk among the UK public (n = 727, volunteer sample), using an online survey. We found thatattribute ratings were predominantly explained via two basic dimensions of riskrelated to public knowledge and dread. We also show that, despite participantsreporting low familiarity with most of the diseases presented, zoonoses wereperceived as essentially avoidable. These findings imply that infection is viewedas dependent upon actions under personal control which has significantimplications for policy development.

TI  - A Medical Student-Run Telehealth Primary Care Clinic During the COVID-19Pandemic: Maintaining Care for the Underserved.
PG  - 21501319221114831
LID - 10.1177/21501319221114831 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this report, we outline our approach to implementing a hybridin-person and virtual clinic model at a student-run free clinic (SRFC) during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES) are at anincreased risk for COVID-19 infection and severe clinical outcomes. It is unclearif telehealth is a viable continuity of care enabler for the underserved.METHODS: The Weill Cornell Community Clinic (WCCC) implemented a novel telehealthclinic model to serve uninsured patients in May 2020. A phone survey of wasconducted to assess WCCC patients access to technology needed for telehealthvisits (eg, personal computers, smartphones). Patient no-show rates wereretrospectively assessed for both in-person (pre-pandemic) and hybrid continuity of care models. RESULTS: The phone survey found that 90% of WCCC patients hadaccess to technology needed for telehealth visits. In the 8 months followingimplementation of the hybrid model, telehealth and in-person no-show rates were11% (14/128) and 15% (10/67) respectively; the combined hybrid no-show rate was12% (24/195). For comparison, the in-person 2019 no-show rate was 23% (84/367).This study aligns with previous reports that telehealth improves patientattendance. CONCLUSION: Literature on the transition of SRFCs from in-person totelehealth care delivery models is limited. At the WCCC, the reduction in no-showrates supports the feasibility and benefits of adopting telehealth for thedelivery of care to underserved patient populations. We believe the hybridtelehealth model described here is a viable model for other student run freeclinics to increase access to care in low SES communities.

TI  - Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceuticals in wastewater treated forbeneficial reuse: Two case studies in central Pennsylvania.
LID - 10.1002/jeq2.20398 [doi]
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance was leveraged as a powerfultool for monitoring community-scale health. Further, the well-known persistenceof some pharmaceuticals through wastewater treatment plants spurred concerns thatincreased usage of pharmaceuticals during the pandemic would increase theconcentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluent. We collected weeklyinfluent and effluent samples from May 2020 through May 2021 from two wastewater treatment plants in central Pennsylvania, the Penn State Water ReclamationFacility and the University Area Joint Authority, that provide effluent forbeneficial reuse, including for irrigation. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 (influent only), two over-the-counter medicines (acetaminophen and naproxen),five antibiotics (ampicillin, doxycycline, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, andtrimethoprim), two therapeutic agents (remdesivir and dexamethasone), andhydroxychloroquine. While there were no correlations between pharmaceutical andvirus concentration, remdesivir detection occurred when the number ofhospitalized COVID-19 patients increased and dexamethasone detection co-occurred with the presence of COVID-19 patients on ventilators. Additionally, Penn Statedecision-making regarding instruction modes explained the temporal variation ofinfluent pharmaceutical concentrations, with detection occurring primarily whenstudents were on campus. Risk quotients calculated for pharmaceuticals with knownEC50 or LC50 values for fish, daphnia, and algae were generally low in theeffluent; however, some acute risks from sulfamethoxazole and dexamethasone were high when students returned to campus. Remdesivir and dexamethasone persistedthrough the wastewater treatment plants, thereby introducing novelpharmaceuticals directly to soils and surface water. These results highlightconnections between human health and water quality during and further demonstratebroad utility of wastewater surveillance.

AB  - Background: The clinical course, comorbidity, and management of symptoms afterthe acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain controversial.Methods: This was a descriptive case series study, examining the characteristics of patients with longstanding symptoms related to COVID-19 who visited ouroutpatient clinic between 1 June and 31 December 2021. We analyzed patients'background, chief complaints, clinical course after COVID-19 onset, and clinical examination results. Results: A total of 90 patients with a mean age of 39.8years were confirmed as having long COVID. The median time between diagnosis ofCOVID-19 and visiting our clinic was 66.8 days, and 89 patients (98.9%) wereunvaccinated. Depression was the most common comorbidity (nine patients, 10.0%). The most common chief complaint was disturbance of smell and/or taste (35,38.9%), followed by memory disturbance (22, 24.4%) and fatigue (29, 31.1%). Head MRI was performed for 42 (46.7%) patients, and the most common finding wassinusitis (four patients). Olfactory testing was conducted in 25 patients (27.8%)using a T&T olfactometer, and 14 patients (56%) had mild olfactory impairment. Ofthe five odors in the T&T, recognition of beta-phenylethyl alcohol was mostimpaired. Conclusions: This study describes the basic characteristics of longCOVID in Japan. It suggests that long COVID is complex because it results in awide range of symptoms.

TI  - Rapid Onset Functional Tic-Like Disorder Outbreak: A Challenging DifferentialDiagnosis in the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 144-151
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have observed an unexpectedincrease in the number of adolescents and young adults presenting with rapidonset functional tic-like behaviours after being exposed to social media content of others displaying a similar pattern of functional tics. Many of these patientshave been referred to Movement Disorders Clinics with misdiagnoses of late-onset refractory Tourette Syndrome after failing different pharmacological treatmentsfor tics. Tourette Syndrome is a well-known condition with clear clinicaldiagnostic criteria and which presents with the insidious onset of simple motorand phonic tics in a rostro-caudal evolution starting in early childhood.Clinical and demographic aspects can differentiate rapid onset functionaltic-like behaviours from Tourette Syndrome, including the former having abruptand explosive presentation of severe symptoms, later age of onset, female gender predominance, lack of suppressibility, comorbid anxiety and depression, atypical premonitory urge and history of exposure to social media content displayingtic-like behaviours. This new presentation of a functional neurological disorder may be explained in part by the relationship between social media exposure totic-like behaviours, and maladaptive response to anxiety caused by life stressors(e.g. COVID-19 pandemic), especially in young individuals. Rapid onset functionaltic-like behaviours may be considered a spreading neuropsychiatric disorder that is potentially fostered by the psychosocial impact caused by the COVID-19pandemic.

TI  - An application of a TVP-VAR extended joint connected approach to exploreconnectedness between WTI crude oil, gold, stock and cryptocurrencies during the COVID-19 health crisis.
PG  - 121909
LID - 10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121909 [doi]
AB  - We employ a time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) in combinationwith an extended joint connectedness approach to study interlinkages between fourmarkets, namely the crude oil, gold, stock, and cryptocurrency markets, bycharacterizing the connectedness of these four markets, from January 1, 2018, to August 1, 2021. Our results demonstrate that health shocks appear to influencethe system-wide dynamic connectedness, which reaches a peak during the COVID-19pandemic. Net total directional connectedness suggests that the gold and stockmarkets consistently appear to be net receivers of spillover shocks. Crude oilappears to be a critical net transmitter of shocks for almost the wholepre-COVID-19 pandemic period, but it turns into an important net receiver during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cryptocurrency market acts as the time-varying netreceiver and net transmitter of our network, and it has the most inconsiderablerole within our studied network. Pairwise connectedness reveals that crude oiland stock are mostly receiving spillover effects from all the other markets,while gold could be either a net transmitter or a net receiver, depending on the types of market considered. Cryptocurrency is a volatile market, and its rolevaries constantly over time.

AB  - China experienced a resurgence of seasonal influenza activity throughout 2021despite intermittent control measures and prolonged international border closure.We show genomic evidence for multiple A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B/Victoriatransmission lineages circulating over 3 years, with the 2021 resurgence mainlydriven by two B/Victoria clades. Phylodynamic analysis revealed unsampledancestry prior to widespread outbreaks in December 2020, showing that influenzalineages can circulate cryptically under non-pharmaceutical interventions enactedagainst COVID-19. Novel haemagglutinin gene mutations and altered age profiles ofinfected individuals were observed, and Jiangxi province was identified as amajor source for nationwide outbreaks. Following major holiday periods,fluctuations in the effective reproduction number were observed, underscoring theimportance of influenza vaccination prior to holiday periods or travel. Extensiveheterogeneity in seasonal influenza circulation patterns in China determined byhistorical strain circulation indicates that a better understanding ofdemographic patterns is needed for improving effective controls.

PG  - veac063
LID - 10.1093/ve/veac063 [doi]
AB  - Human ACE2 Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the key cellattachment and entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), with the original SARS-CoV-2 isolates unable to use mouse ACE2(mACE2). Herein we describe the emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 strain capable ofACE2-independent infection and the evolution of mouse-adapted (MA) SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro serial passaging of virus in co-cultures of cell lines expressing hACE2 and mACE2. MA viruses evolved with up to five amino acid changes in the spikeprotein, all of which have been seen in human isolates. MA viruses replicated to high titers in C57BL/6J mouse lungs and nasal turbinates and causedcharacteristic lung histopathology. One MA virus also evolved to replicateefficiently in several ACE2-negative cell lines across several species, includingclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associatedprotein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) ACE2 knockout cells. An E484D substitution is likelyinvolved in ACE2-independent entry and has appeared in only approximately 0.003per cent of human isolates globally, suggesting that it provided no significantselection advantage in humans. ACE2-independent entry reveals a SARS-CoV-2infection mechanism that has potential implications for disease pathogenesis,evolution, tropism, and perhaps also intervention development.

Although this video teleconferencing softwarefacilitated communication between students and faculty around the world,technically the blank, silenced log-in screens removed the "connectedness" of theclassroom. A medical educator plays music during the pre-class Zoom synchronoussession as an approach to encourage a positive learning environment in apreclinical science course.

TI  - Implementation and Challenges of Online Education during the COVID-19 Outbreak: ANational Survey of Children and Parents in China.
LID - 10.1016/j.ecresq.2022.07.004 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to explore the implementation and challenges of China's national online education strategy - "Suspending Classes Without Stopping Learning"(SCWSL) - during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of children and theirparents. Altogether 28,334 children (aged 6-8 years) and their parents wererandomly sampled from nine cities in five provinces of China, and a mixed-method design involving a questionnaire and interviews was used. The results indicatedthat: (1) most children had participated in online education characterized bywide-ranging content, teacher-led interaction, and rich learning platforms; (2)online education had a negative impact on children's physical and mental health; (3) parent pressure was at a medium to high level due to online education; and(4) parents perceived that online education was less effective than offlineeducation, and this perception varied significantly between geographical regions,living areas, and school types. These findings reveal that the suddenimplementation of nationwide online education created many challenges, and alsoprovided practical implications for countries carrying out online education inthe post-pandemic era.

TI  - Futures for Post-Pandemic Mathematics Teacher Education: responsiveness andresponsibility in the Face of a Crisis.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/s11858-022-01394-y [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruption to mathematics teacher educationworldwide. This paper is anchored in our learnings from the experiences ofteacher educators at four major universities from the Association of SoutheastAsian Nations as they dealt with changes in their programs' delivery triggered bythe pandemic, and raises challenges that remain for the futures of post-pandemic mathematics teacher education. Here, we use the two ethical constructs ofresponsiveness and responsibility to guide actions in response to a crisis, inorder to discuss a range of decisions the participants made to respond to thecrisis. Behind their initial response to the emergent conditions, theparticipants were concerned about maintaining the continuity of their students'education. Further, we identify remaining challenges for mathematics teachereducators to re-imagine their curriculum, teaching, assessment, and equitableaccess towards a more relevant, productive, and equitable mathematics teachereducation. This study adds to the rapidly increasing literature on the effect of the pandemic on mathematics education in the following three ways: (1) here wetake a comprehensive view of the disruptions instigated by the pandemic;, (2) we pay special attention to issues of equity; and (3) we address concerns aboutpossible and desirable post-pandemic futures.

AB  - Objectives: : Through April 2021, sixteen months into the pandemic and fourmonths after availability of COVID-19 vaccines, estimate the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Canada. Methods: : We searched publication databases, preprintservers, public health databases and the grey literature for seroprevalencesurveys conducted in Canada from November 1, 2019, to July 10, 2021. Studies wereassessed for bias using the Joanna Briggs Checklist. Number infections derivedfrom seroprevalence estimates were compared to reported cases to estimateunder-ascertainment ratios. Results: : We identified 12 serosurveys with 210,321 participants. Three (25%) serosurveys were conducted at the national level, 1(8.3%) at the provincial level, and 8 (66.7%) at the local level. All 12serosurveys had moderate or high risk of bias. The proportion infected by April2021 was low (2.6%). The proportion infected were higher in surveys of residents of long-term care facilities (43.0% - 86%), workers at long-term care facilities (22.4%-32.4%), and workers in healthcare institutions (1.4% - 14%). Conclusions: : As of April 2021, the proportion of the Canadians infected by SARS-CoV-2 waslow in the overall population but high in healthcare facilities, particularlylong-term care facilities, supporting the need for vaccines.

AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune response and produces protectiveantibodies, and these changes may persist after patients discharged fromhospital. Methods: This study conducted a one-year follow-up study on patientswith COVID-19 to observe the dynamic changes of circulating leukocyte subsets andvirus-specific antibodies. Results: A total of 66 patients with COVID-19 and 213 healthy patients with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were included. Thevirus-specific total antibody, IgG and IgM antibody of patients after one year ofrecovery were higher than those of healthy vaccinated participants (94.13 vs4.65, 2.67 vs 0.44, 0.09 vs 0.06, respectively) (P < 0.001). Neutrophil count (OR= 1.73, 95% CI: 1.10-2.70, P = 0.016) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR =1.59, 95% CI: 1.05-2.41, P = 0.030) at discharge were the influencing factors forthe positivity of virus-specific IgG antibody in patients after one year ofrecovery. The counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T, B and NK cells increased with the timeof recovery, and remained basically stable from 9 to 12 months after discharge.After 12 months, the positivity of IgG antibody was 85.3% and IgM was 11.8%,while the virus-specific antibody changed dynamically in patients within one yearafter discharge. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody of recoveredpatients showed dynamic fluctuation after discharge, while the leukocyte subsets gradually increased and basically stabilized after 9 months.

PG  - 2670
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2670 [doi]
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) led to extreme actions being taken by the governments to restrict the spread of this virus.Closure of schools, sport clubs and playgrounds were among these actions;children had to stay indoors and were not allowed to pursue their normallifestyle activities. Objectives: To assess the differences in health-relatedbehaviors among Jordanian school-aged children (6-16 years) before and duringCOVID-19 quarantine and to evaluate public's perception of the role ofpharmacists regarding children's health-related behaviors management. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to January 2021 using ananonymous web-based survey. The survey was developed based on previouslypublished surveys. Evaluation of the validity and reliability of the survey were conducted by a professional committee of clinical pharmacists and a statistician.Results: A total of 230 children, aged 9.02+/- 2.977 participated in the study.Physical activity and healthy balanced meals decreased (less than 1 hr or 1-3hrs/week vs 2 meals/day, p= <0.001), whereas daily screen time (1-3 hrs/week vs4-6 hrs/week, p= <0.001), sleep hours (8-9 hrs/day vs 10-11 hrs/day, p= <0.001)and the ingestion of unhealthy snacks had increased (1-2 meals/day vs. 2-3meals/day, p=<0.001). A positive perception of pharmacists' role during thepandemic was revealed. Conclusion: The present study showed that a significantchange in children's health-related behavior happened during the COVID-19pandemic. Such changes can lead to social, physical and mental health problems.The public perceived community pharmacists as trusted health care professionalsduring the pandemic.

TI  - The rise of telepharmacy services during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comprehensiveassessment of services in the United Arab Emirates.
PG  - 2634
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2634 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The study aimed to explore changes in community pharmacies' processes in response to the pandemic in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and factorsaffecting the adoption of these changes. Method: A cross-sectional study wasconducted using a self-administered questionnaire that was distributed tolicensed community pharmacists in the UAE. The survey used to collect informationon the type of telepharmacy services and related topics such as constraints andsupports. The evaluation of services was done for three periods: before, duringand after lockdown. Results: The number of completed surveys was 391. Themajority of the participants were under 35 years old (79.5%), female (65.0%),with a bachelor's degree (82.6%), and working in a pharmacy group (70.6%).Pharmacies provided the services by phone (95.6%) and/or messaging applications(80.0%) such as WhatsApp and Messenger. The community pharmacies provided avariety of services using telepharmacy tools such as managing of mild diseases,dispensing and delivering prescribed and OTC medications, general healthinformation, and services for patients with chronic disease. The main factorsthat had significant effects on several telepharmacy services were pharmacies'type (group/chain vs. individual) and the number of pharmacists in the pharmacy(p < 0.05). Lack of time, training and financial support were the main barriersassociated with telepharmacy services among individual pharmacies. Conclusion:Telepharmacy supported the work of community pharmacies during the COVID-19pandemic by facilitating the provision of pharmaceutical services. Although theoccurrence of several financial and technical problems, it appeared lessfrequently in pharmacy chains with a large number of pharmacists.

PG  - 2665
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2665 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the co-infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) amongpatients with asthma exacerbation and COVID-19 in Jordan. Also, to determine the frequency of acute asthma exacerbation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic ona matched basis. Methods: The data of this prospective cohort research consisted of clinical variables. During the first visit, and after 14-days, nasopharyngeal swabs were taken and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed forHRV and SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results: Forty-seven out of 175 (26.9%) COVID-19adult cases have been diagnosed with asthma. The number of asthma exacerbationsamong the study participants was higher during 2021 than in 2020 (p=0.035). Most of the included asthmatic participants (61.7%) were only positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 38.3% were co-infected with HRV. The SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold value waslower in samples infected with both viruses compared to samples infected withSARS-CoV-2 alone, p<0.005. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that HRV andSARS-CoV-2 were significantly more prevalent in asthma exacerbations than stable asthma. Thus, HRV and/or SARS-CoV-2 infections were potentially cofactors orcontributors to the asthma exacerbation in this cohort. This is the first study, in Jordan, to investigate the HRV co-infection in COVID-19 asthmatic patients andHRV could be related with a higher severity of COVID-19.

TI  - What do persons with diabetes want from community pharmacies? A qualitativestudy.
PG  - 2677
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2677 [doi]
AB  - Background: Diabetes is a demanding disease with a complex treatment regimen.Many persons with diabetes have difficulty managing their disease and takingmedication as prescribed, possibly because they lack knowledge and sometimesmisinterpret medical benefits. Community pharmacies continuously provideprofessional counselling to persons with diabetes. Objective: This study aimed toexplore 1) which services adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes want fromcommunity pharmacies and 2) how pharmacies can meet these wishes. Methods: Aqualitative, explorative study design using focus group interviews was chosen.Informants were recruited from Region Zealand in Denmark. Data were digitallyrecorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed by means of thematic analysis.Results: Thirteen adults (11 female) with the mean age of 66.2 years (range 49-81years) participated in one physical (n=6) or one online (n=7) focus groupinterview. Ten had type 2 diabetes, three had type 1 diabetes. The averageduration of participants' diabetes was 13.4 years (range 2.3-33.0 years). Theanalysis revealed three overall themes of the functions which the informantswould like community pharmacies to fulfil: 1) raise awareness of pharmacies'counselling service and competences; 2) act as a dialogue partner; 3) be a sourceof information and guidance about local activities and support. Conclusion: Theinformants did not regard community pharmacies as a natural part of thehealthcare system or as a place where they would expect counselling. They wouldlike the community pharmacy to make their medical competences and servicesobvious and the community pharmacy staff to act as a dialogue partner and providecompetent counselling. The informants would like to have a contact person withdiabetes competences with whom they can book an appointment to complementover-the-counter counselling. They experience a gap in their care between routinevisits in the healthcare system and suggest that community pharmacies counsellingservices become a natural supplement and that healthcare professionals in theprimary and secondary sectors inform patients about the services - especially forpatients newly diagnosed with diabetes. Finally, they would like a formalcollaboration between diabetes associations and community pharmacies to maketheir competences, services and information visible.

LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2652 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of an online tutorial and its impact on improving knowledge and skills of pharmacy students in the clinicalproblem-solving process that is necessary to implement pharmaceutical care.Methods: This is a prospective interventional study conducted during the COVID-19pandemic restrictions using four novel templates. The first two levels ofKirkpatrick's Model (Reaction and Learning) were used. Results: 129 participants completed all of the online training parts. The findings indicated a significant improvement in the students' knowledge and skills. The participants achievedhigher score following the tutorial than the baseline, with a statisticallysignificant difference (p < 0.001). There was a significant improvement in thenumber of detected treatment-related problems. The majority of students weresatisfied with the overall training process and stated a high evaluation scoreout of 10 (mean = 7.93 +/- 1.42, median = 8.00). Conclusion: The educationalintervention achieved a substantial positive impact on decision-making skills of participating students and was considered effective in helping them attain basic skills such as teamwork, peer assessment, communication and critical evaluation. Healthcare providers must work together to ensure accurate medication use during care transitions. Pharmacists, as medication experts, play an important role inthe implementation process. Pharmacy educators must prepare pharmacy student touse pharmaceutical care in their future practice.

PG  - 2678
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2678 [doi]
AB  - The vaccine was the only way to fight against Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) from its statement as a pandemic till day. COVID-19 vaccines were approved by the worldhealth organization (WHO) in December 2020. Despite a large number of studiesregarding the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, to our knowledge, therewere limited studies that outlined the gender disparity towards COVID-19 vaccine adverse effects. This study aims to outline the variety of side effects among menand women after getting COVID-19 vaccines (either single or two doses). It is across-sectional study accomplished electronically from September to November2021. The participants involved were 843 Health Care Workers (HCWs) fromdifferent cities in Iraq. The majority of respondents were females (664). Around 65% of males experienced adverse effects compared to 77% of females. A highfrequency of severe pain was reported among females. Regarding dermatologicalreactions like swelling, redness and skin rash were also higher reported amongfemale subjects. In addition to that, higher frequencies of moderate and severesystemic adverse effects and mild to moderate nausea was also reported morefrequently among females. In terms of cardiopulmonary adverse effects, all thereported adverse effects were found more frequently among females. In conclusion,COVID-19 vaccines produced limited adverse effects and the majority of them were reported among women. This may be associated with hormonal and psychologicalfactors related to them.

AB  - Background: Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United ArabEmirates (UAE) government has taken a series of preventive measures to controlthe spread of the Coronavirus. Dealing with the unforeseen challenges caused bythe pandemic has had a profound impact on people all around the world.Pharmacists played an important public health role during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they were the first point of contact with the public and the first source of information, providing accurate and reliable management and preventive measures. The aim of this study was to analyse the distress symptoms and the associatedfactors among a sample of the UAE population. Materials and Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional study conducted over the period of September toOctober 2020. A bilingual online self-administered questionnaire was distributed among individuals aged 15 years and above. Data was analyzed using StatisticalPackage for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: Most of the students in the samplefound online learning less effective than in-class learning. Among these, 49.9%and 62.8 % reported that they had normal sleep and eating habits, respectively.In all the sample, most of the participants (96%) were adherent to preventivemeasures. Higher levels of distress during the COVID-19 lockdown were found amongfemales, individuals younger than 35 years old, those who neglected personalhygiene and who had worse quality of family gatherings and relationships.Conclusion: This study identified factors associated with distress symptomsexperienced by people during the lockdown and perceived attitudes regardingonline learning, preventive measures and changes in people's behaviours andfamily environment. Knowledge about how lockdown has affected the lives of thepopulations can be used to design public health interventions aimed at promoting the health and well-being of the communities.

AB  - People from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) represent large portions of the world population, often occupy less favorable living conditions, andtypically suffer greater health risks, yet frequently receive little research andglobal health attention. The present study reviews emerging evidence onproblematic use of the internet (PUI) in LMICs prior/during the COVID-19pandemic. Analyzed studies mainly focused on general properties of PUI inuniversity students, problematic gaming in youth, or problematic use of socialmedia in adults, registering higher prevalence estimates, as compared to earlier reports. Research mainly focused on initially affected regions and COVID-exposed populations. Overall, unfavorable circumstances including poor social support,family relationships and lifestyle tendencies/habits may present potential riskfor PUI in LMICs, likely exacerbated during the pandemic.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the coping strategies of Nigerian medical studentsduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: We conducted an online descriptivecross-sectional study among medical and dental students attending three of thelargest Colleges of Medicine in the Southwestern zone of Nigeria. Settings: Ourstudy involved students across the pre-clinical and clinical levels of the three Colleges of Medicine. Participants: We selected the respondents through apurposive sampling technique and disseminated questionnaires applied using anonline survey platform (Google forms https://forms.gle/19yfEzehJKwsme759). Atotal of 1010 participants out of 2404 eligible students completed thequestionnaires accurately, giving a response rate of 42%. Methods: The Brief-COPEquestionnaire assessed the participants' coping strategies (approach andavoidant) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a bivariate analysis usingthe chi-square test and multiple regression analysis (p< 0.05) to determine thepredictors of avoidant coping strategies. Results: Respondents mean age was21.8+/-2.9 years, results were presented as Odds Ratios(OR) at 95% confidenceintervals(CI). About 95% of respondents employed an approach coping strategy,while the minority(5%) adopted an avoidant coping strategy. Females were threetimes more likely to employ an avoidant coping strategy (OR=3.32 (95% CI1.67-6.21) compared to male students. Conclusion: This study reveals that themajority of the respondents employed an approach coping strategy towards theCOVID-19 pandemic. Females were more likely to employ an avoidant copingstrategy. We recommend gender-specific programs to help medical students copewith the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding: No External Funding.

TI  - Risk factors of hikikomori among office workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Aprospective online survey.
PG  - 1-19
LID - 10.1007/s12144-022-03446-8 [doi]
AB  - The global pandemic of COVID-19 has forced people to restrict their outings. InJapan, self-restraint behavior (SRB) has been requested by the government, andsome of those decreasing their outings may shift to pathological socialwithdrawal; hikikomori. The purpose of this study was to examine the risk factorsof hikikomori conducting an online prospective survey. An online survey wasconducted in June 2020 and December 2020; (1) SRB-related indicators (degree ofSRB, motivation for SRB, stigma and self-stigma toward COVID-19, anxiety anddepressive feelings toward COVID-19) and (2) general mental health (hikikomoritendency, depressive symptoms, modern type depression (MTD) tendency, internetaddiction) were collected. A cross-lagged effects model was performed to examine the association between these variables. Lack of emotional support and lack ofsocialization in June 2020 increased isolation in December 2020. Besides, MTD andhikikomori interacted with each other. Interestingly, although hikikomoritendency increased depressive tendencies, SRB itself did not have a significantpath on any mental health-related variables. Poor interpersonal relationships,rather than SRB per se, are suggested to be a risk factor for increased isolationamong office workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate early interventionssuch as interpersonal or emotional support may prevent the transition topathological hikikomori. The association between MTD and hikikomori seems toreveal the interesting possibility that MTD is a gateway to increased risk ofhikikomori, and that hikikomori is a gateway to MTD as well. Future research isrequired to elucidate the relationship between hikikomori and MTD.

AB  - With the frequent detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) in dwellings and wastewater, the risk of transmission ofenvironmental contaminants is of great concern. Fast, simple and sensitivesensors are essential for timely detecting infection and controlling transmissionthrough environment fomites. Herein, we developed a Surface Enhanced RamanScattering (SERS) aptasensor, which can realize ultrasensitive and rapid assay ofSARS-CoV-2 viral particles. In this strategy, we designed a novel lockingamplifier which is activated only in the presence of virus by aptamerrecognition. The reaction process was carried out though one-pot method at 37degrees C, which can save time and resources. In addition, magnetic beads used inreaction system can simplify operation, as well as provide ideas for developingbiosensing robots via magnetic field. This SERS aptasensor can detect SARS-CoV-2 virus with a LOD of 260 TU/microL within 40 min in the linear range of 625-10000 TU/microL. Therefore, this convenience, speediness, sensitivity, and selectivity of detection has great prospects in analyzing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles or otherviruses in environment as well as monitoring of environmental virus sources.

TI  - Adaptive immunity and vaccination - iron in the spotlight.
PG  - ltab007
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab007 [doi]
AB  - Vaccination programmes are critically important to suppress the burden ofinfectious diseases, saving countless lives globally, as emphasised by thecurrent COVID-19 pandemic. Effective adaptive immune responses are complexprocesses subject to multiple influences. Recent genetic, pre-clinical, andclinical studies have converged to show that availability of iron is a key factorregulating the development of T and B cell responses to infection andimmunisation. Lymphocytes obtain iron from circulating transferrin. The amount ofiron bound to transferrin is dependent on dietary iron availability and isdecreased during inflammation via upregulation of the iron-regulatory hormone,hepcidin. As iron deficiency and chronic inflammatory states are both globallyprevalent health problems, the potential impact of low iron availability onimmune responses is significant. We describe the evidence supporting theimportance of iron in immunity, highlight important unknowns, and discuss howtherapeutic interventions to modulate iron availability might be implementable inthe context of vaccination and infectious disease.

TI  - Effect of treatment regimens in severe COVID pneumonia at an Indian tertiary carehospital: An observational, real-world study.
LID - 10.1016/j.mjafi.2022.05.009 [doi]
AB  - Background: Corticosteroids have attracted attention as a treatment option forsevere Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, published data on steroid therapyis debatable, and real-world data is lacking. This study evaluated the effect of treatment regimens, especially Pulse steroid therapy (Injection MethylPrednisolone 250 mg iv once a day for three days) in severe-COVID-19 pneumonia atan Indian tertiary care hospital. Methods: This observational cross-sectionalstudy included severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients aged >18 years, requiringassisted ventilation. As part of the hospital protocol, patients received either pulse steroid therapy, remdesivir or tocilizumab in addition to the recommendedsteroid doses i.e., injection of dexamethasone 6 mg iv once a day. Theassociation of factors and treatment regimens to patient outcomes was evaluated. Results: Data of eighty-three patients were assessed, majority being above 60years (n = 30, 36.14%) and males (n = 45/83, 54.21%). The commonest comorbiditieswere hypertension (n = 26), diabetes (n = 23) and obesity (n = 19), fifty-fivepatients (66.26%) reported at least one comorbidity. Sixty-one patients (73.49%) had received pulse steroid regimen, forty-eight patients (57.83%) wereadministered remdesivir-based regimen while twelve patients (14.46%) had receivedtocilizumab treatment. 54.1% patients managed with pulse steroid regimens weredischarged after treatment, statistically similar to remdesivir-managed subgroup (62.5%, p > 0.05). On sub-group analysis, pulse steroids showed better outcomesin young males with no comorbidities. No comorbidity had significant relationshipwith patient outcomes (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Pulse steroid therapy is aneffective therapy in management of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in areal-world setting, with better outcomes in young males without comorbidities.Pulse steroids can be considered a viable option for severe-COVID-19 pneumoniamanagement.

PG  - 103214
LID - 10.1016/j.advengsoft.2022.103214 [doi]
AB  - World Health Organization has defined COVID-19 as a contagious, communicable and fast spreading disease engendered by the Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, is arespirational microorganism. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan images of thechest helps in detecting COVID 19 infection in a fast way with much reliability. In this paper, chest CT scan images of COVID and Non-COVID categories areconsidered to train the supervised classifier, Iterative convolution NeuralNetwork. The training process is done with six different training data size. The trained models are iterated for the fixed size of testing data (20 images). Thesame set of training and testing processes are done with two different Iterative Convolutional Neural Network architectures, one with two hidden layers (CNN1) andanother with three hidden layers (CNN2). The iterations are extended up to 7, butthe model performance is degraded after the 6(th) iteration, which makes to fixthe iteration level as 5 for both CNN models. Six different training sets withfive iterations have led into 30 CNN models. For two different CNN architectures,which lead to 60 different models. The model designed with 100 training sets inboth CNN1 and CNN2, have produced the high accuracy in COVID classification than any other models. The better classification accuracy 89% is achieved from CNN2model with its 5(th) iteration.

TI  - Highly private blockchain-based management system for digital COVID-19certificates.
PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1007/s10207-022-00598-3 [doi]
AB  - As a result of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, several proposals ofblockchain-based solutions for digital COVID-19 certificates have been presented.Considering that health data have high privacy requirements, a health datamanagement system must fulfil several strict privacy and security requirements.On the one hand, confidentiality of the medical data must be assured, being thedata owner (the patient) the actor that maintain control over the privacy oftheir certificates. On the other hand, the entities involved in the generationand validation of certificates must be supervised by a regulatory authority. Thisset of requirements are generally not achieved together in previous proposals.Moreover, it is required that a digital COVID-19 certificate management protocol provides an easy verification process and also strongly avoid the risk offorgery. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a protocol to manage digital COVID-19 certificates where individual users decide how to sharetheir private data in a hierarchical system. In order to achieve this, we puttogether two different technologies: the use of a proxy re-encryption (PRE)service in conjunction with a blockchain-based protocol. Additionally, ourprotocol introduces an authority to control and regulate the centers that cangenerate digital COVID-19 certificates and offers two kinds of validation ofcertificates for registered and non-registered verification entities. Therefore, the paper achieves all the requirements, that is, data sovereignty, high privacy,forgery avoidance, regulation of entities, security and easy verification.

PG  - 100158
LID - 10.1016/j.clinpr.2022.100158 [doi]
AB  - Background: TAFRO syndrome, a subtype of idiopathic multicentric Castlemandisease, is an acute or subacute systemic inflammatory disease that causes fever,generalized oedema (pleural effusion or ascites), and thrombocytopenia and isassociated with renal impairment, anaemia, and organomegaly (hepatosplenomegalyand lymph node enlargement). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associatedhyperinflammation is caused by dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines.Cytokine storm syndrome is common to both COVID-19 and TAFRO syndrome.Casereport.A 66-year-old man with TAFRO syndrome was admitted because of worseningrenal function, right pleural effusion, and ascites. He was taking 20 mgprednisolone orally and 25 mg cyclosporin A orally twice daily. Despiteadministration of maximum oxygenation and remdesivir, the patient developed acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was transferred to the intensive careunit. Results: Chest radiography showed bilateral lung infiltration. COVID-19 wasconfirmed with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Chest and abdominal computed tomographyshowed massive ground-glass opacities in both lungs, slight right pleuraleffusion, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and ascites. Conclusion: To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first report of COVID-19 in a patient with TAFRO syndrome.Despite receiving a moderate dose of a corticosteroid and a monoclonal antibodyagainst the IL-6 receptor, our patient developed severe pneumonia, suggestingthat strong immunomodulatory therapy in the antiviral phase of COVID-19 maypromote viral growth and induce ARDS.

AB  - The hospitals in Japan have hitherto had complete autonomy in deciding whether toadmit COVID-19 patients. In fact, they were "swinging" between admitting or notCOVID-19 patients, especially during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. To addressendogenous decision making, we estimated the effect of admitting COVID-19patients on hospital profits using instrumental variable (IV) regression. Wederived the IVs from the guidelines of the national government on which hospital types should admit COVID-19 patients. Our empirical results revealed that themonthly profits per bed decreased by approximately JPY 600,000 ( approximatelyUSD 4615), which is 15 times the average monthly profit in 2019. Thisoverwhelming financial damage indicates it is costly for some hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients because of their low suitability in admitting such patients.Based on the implications of our main results, we propose an alternative strategyto handling patient surges in case of new infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges to humanity nowadays.COVID-19 virus can replicate in the host's larynx region, which is in contrast toother viruses that replicate in lungs only, i.e. SARS. This is conjectured tosupport a fast spread of COVID-19. However, there is sparse research in thisfield about quantitative comparison of virus load in the larynx for varyingsusceptible individuals. In this regard the lung geometry itself could influence the risk of reproducing more pathogens and consequently exhaling more virus.Disadvantageously, there are only sparse lung geometries available. To still beable to investigate realistic geometrical deviations we employ three differentdigital replicas of human airways up to the 7 th level of bifurcation,representing two realistic lungs (male and female) as well as a more simplifiedexperimental model. Our aim is to investigate the influence of breathingscenarios on aerosol deposition in anatomically different, realistic humanairways. In this context, we employ three levels of cardiovascular activity aswell as reported experimental particle size distributions by means ofComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with special focus on the larynx region toenable new insights into the local virus loads in human respiratory tracts. Inaddition, the influence of more realistic boundary conditions is investigated by performing transient simulations of a complete respiratory cycle in the upperlung regions of the considered respiratory models, focusing in particular ondeposition in the oral cavity, the laryngeal region, and trachea, whilesimplifying the tracheobronchial tree. The aerosol deposition is modeled viaOpenFOAM(\protect \relax \special {t4ht=(R)}) by employing an Euler-Lagrangianframe including steady and unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)resolved turbulent flow using the k- omega -SST and k- omega -SST DES turbulence models. We observed that the respiratory geometry altered the local depositionpatterns, especially in the laryngeal region. Despite the larynx region, theeffects of varying flow rate for the airway geometries considered were found tobe similar in the majority of respiratory tract regions. For all particle sizedistributions considered, localized particle accumulation occurred in the larynx of all considered lung models, which were more pronounced for larger particlesize distributions. Moreover, it was found, that employing transient simulations instead of steady-state analysis, the overall particle deposition pattern ismaintained, however with a stronger intensity in the transient cases.

AB  - A healthy diet and dietary supplements have gained attention as potentialco-adjuvants in managing and preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thispaper critically reviews the current evidence regarding the impact of diet andsupplements on the prevention and progression of COVID-19. According to availabledata, a healthy diet and normal weight are considered protective factors.Regarding dietary supplementation, the most robust results from human studies arefor vitamin C, which appears to decrease inflammatory markers and suppresscytokine storm. A small, randomized trial showed that a high dose of vitamin Dsignificantly reduced the need for intensive care unit treatment of patientsrequiring hospitalization for COVID-19. According to retrospective human studies,there is limited evidence for vitamin E and selenium supplements. Animal studies have investigated the effects of green tea and curcumin. Xanthohumol andprobiotics, interesting for their antiviral, anti-inflammatory, andimmunoregulatory properties, need formal clinical study. In summary, there ispromising evidence supporting the role of diet and supplements as co-adjuvants inthe treatment of COVID-19. Further studies and properly designed clinical trials are necessary to draw more robust conclusions; however, it is not unreasonable totake a pragmatic approach and promote the use of appropriate diet and supplementsto counter the effects of COVID-19, ideally with a mechanism to assess outcomes.

LID - 10.1016/j.csda.2022.107581 [doi]
AB  - Large spatial datasets with many spatial covariates have become ubiquitous inmany fields in recent years. A question of interest is to identify whichcovariates are likely to influence a spatial response, and whether and how theeffects of these covariates vary across space, including potential abrupt changesfrom region to region. To solve this question, a new efficient regularizedspatially clustered coefficient (RSCC) regression approach is proposed, whichcould achieve variable selection and identify latent spatially heterogeneouscovariate effects with clustered patterns simultaneously. By carefully designing the regularization term of RSCC as a chain graph guided fusion penalty plus agroup lasso penalty, the RSCC model is computationally efficient for largespatial datasets while still achieving the theoretical guarantees for estimation.RSCC also adopts the idea of adaptive learning to allow for adaptive weights and adaptive graphs in its regularization terms and further improves the estimationperformance. RSCC is applied to study the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines usingcounty-level data in the United States and discover the determinants ofvaccination acceptance with varying effects across counties, revealing important within-state and across-state spatially clustered patterns of covariates effects.

AB  - America's housing affordability crisis has had various indirect costs on healthand safety among people living with disability. The skyrocketing housing priceshave exponentially increased with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic leaving manypeople at risk for eviction after federal and local moratoriums providingprotection during the pandemic expire. Americans with disabilities have beenparticularly affected by the affordability crisis and it is expected that thismajor public health problem will only grow as government-provided protections andsupports wane. It is critical that both government and various housingorganizations consider ways to support affordability, quality, and accessibility in this particularly hard-hit population.

PG  - e12793
LID - 10.1002/emp2.12793 [doi]
AB  - Objective: We aimed to identify risk factors for hospital admission and severedisease among fully vaccinated (FV) individuals with COVID-19. Further, weinvestigated if risk factors for hospitalization and severe disease are similarbetween unvaccinated (UV) and vaccinated individuals. Methods: This was amulticenter, observational cohort analysis from a large regional healthcaresystem in metro Detroit using electronic health record data to evaluate riskfactors for hospitalization and severe COVID-19 disease. Vaccination data wereretrieved using electronic medical records linked to our statewide immunizationdatabase. Consecutive adult FV and UV patients with a primary admission diagnosisof COVID-19 were included in the comparative analysis. Partially vaccinatedpatients and patients who had received a booster dose were excluded. The primary outcome of this study was hospital admission and severe disease inclusive ofintensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. Results:Between December 15, 2020 and December 19, 2021, 20,584 emergency departmentvisits met our inclusion criteria. Among these, 2005 (9.7%) visits consisted ofFV individuals, 18,579 (90.3%) were UV, and 40.3% of UV and 52.7% of FV required hospitalization with similar (12.7% and 12.6%, respectively) rates of severedisease. Hospitalized UV patients with severe disease were younger than their FV counterparts (49.5% <65 years vs. 13.5% p < 0.001). Risk factors for severedisease on UV and FV included age >/=65 years (UV: adjusted odds ratio [aOR]1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-1.73, p < 0.001 and FV: aOR 2.50, 95% CI 1.44-4.36 p = 0.001) and weighted Elixhauser score >10 (UV: aOR 9.11, 95% CI6.92-12.00, p < 0.001 and FV: aOR 6.04, 95% CI 2.68-13.26, p < 0.001). However,only on UV status, body mass index (BMI) >/=30 kg/m(2) was associated withincreased odds of severe disease (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 2.09-3.22, p < 0.001).Conclusions: FV patients with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection who requirehospitalization and have severe disease are older and have more medicalcomorbidities compared to UV patients. When comparing risk factors for severedisease between UV and FV individuals, FV status is particularly associated with reduced risk among patients with a BMI >/=30 kg/m(2) and a moderate number ofmedical comorbidities, regardless of age, highlighting the importance ofvaccination in these particularly vulnerable groups.

AB  - Objective: Patient crowding and boarding in the emergency department (ED) isassociated with adverse outcomes and has become increasingly problematic inrecent years. We investigated the impact of an ED patient flow countermeasureusing an early warning score. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis ofobservational data from patients who presented to the ED of a Level 1 TraumaCenter in Pennsylvania. We implemented a modified version of the Modified EarlyWarning Score (MEWS), called mMEWS, to address patient flow. Patients aged >/=18 years old admitted to the adult hospital medicine service were included in thestudy. We compared the pre-mMEWS (February 19, 2017-February 18, 2019) to thepost-mMEWS implementation period (February 19, 2019-June 30, 2020). During theintervention, low MEWS (0-1) scoring admissions went directly to the inpatientfloor with expedited orders, the remainder waited in the ED until the hospitalmedicine admitting team evaluated the patient and then placed orders. Weinvestigated the association between mMEWS, ED length of stay (LOS), and 24-hour rapid response team (24 hour-RRT) activation. RRT activation rates were used as ameasure of adverse outcome for the new process and are a network team responsefor admitted patients who are rapidly decompensating. The association betweenmMEWS and the outcomes of ED length of stay in minutes and 24 hour-RRT activationwas assessed using linear and logistic regression adjusting for a priori selectedconfounders, respectively. Results: Of the total 43,892 patients admitted, 19,962(45.5%) were in the pre-mMEWS and 23,930 (54.5%) in the post-mMEWS implementationperiod. The median post-mMEWS ED LOS was shorter than the pre-mMEWS (376 vs 415minutes; P < 0.01). After accounting for potential confounders, there was a 4.57%decrease in the ED LOS after implementing mMEWS (95% confidence interval [CI],4.20-4.94; P < 0.01). The proportion of 24 hour-RRT did not differ significantly when comparing pre- and post-mMEWS (33.5% vs 34.4%; P = 0.83). Conclusion: Theuse of a modified MEWS enhanced admission process to the hospital medicineservice, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, was associated with a significantdecrease in ED LOS without a significant increase in 24 hour-RRT activation.

TI  - Bias from questionnaire invitation and response in COVID-19 research: an example using ALSPAC.

LID - 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17041.2 [doi]
AB  - Background: Longitudinal studies are crucial for identifying potential riskfactors for infection with, and consequences of, COVID-19, but relationships can be biased if they are associated with invitation and response to data collection.We describe factors relating to questionnaire invitation and response in COVID-19questionnaire data collection in a multigenerational birth cohort (the AvonLongitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC). Methods: We analysed online questionnaires completed between the beginning of the pandemic and easing of the first UK lockdown by participants with valid email addresses who had not activelydisengaged from the study. We assessed associations of pre-pandemicsociodemographic, behavioural, anthropometric and health-related factors with: i)being sent a questionnaire; ii) returning a questionnaire; and iii) item response(for specific questions). Analyses were conducted in three cohorts: the indexchildren born in the early 1990s (now young adults; 41 variables assessed), theirmothers (35 variables) and the mothers' partners (27 variables). Results: Of14,849 young adults, 41% were sent a questionnaire, of whom 57% returned one.Item response was >95%. In this cohort, 78% of factors were associated with beingsent a questionnaire, 56% with returning one, and, as an example of itemresponse, 20% with keyworker status response. For instance, children from motherseducated to degree-level had greater odds of being sent a questionnaire (OR=5.59;95% CI=4.87-6.41), returning one (OR=1.60; 95% CI=1.31-1.95), and responding toitems (e.g., keyworker status OR=1.65; 95% CI=0.88-3.04), relative to childrenfrom mothers with fewer qualifications. Invitation and response rates andassociations were similar in all cohorts. Conclusions: These results highlightthe importance of considering potential biases due to non-response when usinglongitudinal studies in COVID-19 research and interpreting results. We recommend researchers report response rates and factors associated with invitation andresponse in all COVID-19 observational research studies, which can informsensitivity analyses.

PG  - 622-625
LID - 10.46234/ccdcw2022.135 [doi]
AB  - What is already known about this topic?: China was certified malaria-free on June30, 2021. However, imported malaria continuously threatens the effort to prevent re-establishment of malaria in China. What is added by this report?: Measuressuch as international travel restrictions, entry quarantine, and screening infever clinics during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) period wereassociated with a significant decrease of imported malaria cases in AnhuiProvince, a higher proportion of non-Plasmodium falciparum (non-P. falciparum)malaria reported infections, and a higher proportion of cases requiring medicalattention at their initial visit. What are the implications for public healthpractices?: It is necessary to be vigilant about imported malaria during theCOVID-19 epidemic, especially for non-P. falciparum infections which are moredifficult to detect, and to promote research, development, and introduction ofmore sensitive and specific point-of-care detection methods for non-P. falciparumspecies.

TI  - Adapting parent-focused interventions for diverse caregivers of children withintellectual and developmental disabilities: Lessons learned during globalcrises.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - Parent-focused interventions have been designed to provide training and supportto caregivers who are essential in achieving positive outcomes for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). In 2020, significant crises,including the COVID-19 pandemic and continued racial tensions, profoundlyimpacted the livelihood of children with IDD and their families. Many ongoingefforts to address disparities among this population were halted temporarily and required further adaptations. Researchers adapted interventions and support toaddress the disparities impacting children with IDD and their families withlimited guidance. We provide a descriptive case analysis of four parent-focusedinterventions that responded to the global crises to continue serving childrenwith IDD and their families. The four distinct programs were based on appliedbehavior analysis and naturalistic, developmental-behavioral paradigms that were culturally adapted for families of young children with IDD from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. We present the qualitative reports on thechallenges and benefits that arose with adapting the four parent-focusedinterventions for telehealth implementation. We focused specifically onadaptations made in recruitment and retention, instrumentation and measurement,research staff training, and intervention delivery. We synthesize our experience with challenges and solutions in adapting parent-focused interventions forracially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children with IDD and theirfamilies. We conclude with recommendations for researchers and practitioners onmethods for adapting parent-focused interventions to address the significanthealth disparities that impact racially, ethnically, and socioeconomicallydiverse children with IDD and their families.

AB  - Feeling part of a community of learners has been shown to foster students'engagement and sense of belonging, leading to higher retention and achievement oflearning outcomes. The pivot to online teaching caused by the COVID-19 pandemichas prompted a reappraisal of all aspects of the student experience, includingstudents' capacity and opportunity to engage in meaningful learning communitiesonline. There has been some emergent literature which considers how to facilitateonline learning communities in the emergency remote teaching context prompted by COVID-19. However, there is a notable lack of literature which considers howlearning communities are defined, understood, and negotiated by students in this unique teaching context. Given how students' perceptions of learning communities contributes to Higher Education policy (e.g. through the National StudentSurvey), this is important to understand. In the present study (N = 309), wequalitatively investigated students' understanding and definition of the term"learning community" during a time of emergency pivot to online teaching andlearning. A reflexive thematic analysis of students' first-hand responsesgenerated three dominant themes: "Feeling connected: Bridging the gap whilstphysically distanced", "Feeling included: Visible and valued", and "Feelingtogether: Mutuality and the shared experience". We discuss the implications forthese conceptualisations of an online learning community and suggest ways forwardfor Higher Education pedagogy.

TI  - Perception of Older Thai Adults in a Do-Not-Attempt Resuscitation Order duringthe COVID-19 Era If Infected with COVID-19.
PG  - 107-115
LID - 10.1089/pmr.2021.0084 [doi]
AB  - Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, older adultsexperienced high mortality rates, and their deaths were often preceded by sudden health deterioration and acute respiratory failure. This prompted older adultsand their families to make rapid goals-of-care decisions. Objective: This studyaimed at determining the prevalence of and factors associated withCOVID-19-related do-not-attempt resuscitation (DNR) decisions among older adults.Design: This was a cross-sectional population-based survey. Setting: Well-lookingactive (mobile) community-dwelling adults aged >/=60 years and residing in theBangkok district, Thailand, between April and May 2020, were included in thisstudy. We excluded older adults who (1) were unable to speak Thai, (2) had severecognitive impairment, or (3) were blind or deaf. We interviewed participantsabout their perceptions regarding end-of-life decisions in case they got infectedwith COVID-19 and experienced respiratory arrest. Results: We recruited 848participants with a mean age of 70.5 (+/-6.74) years. When asked about theirchoice, 49.8% chose a DNR status, 44.5% chose full life support, and 5.8% wereundecided. The three most common reasons provided by the DNR group for theirchoice were old age (54.9%), acceptance of death (15.6%), and fear of pain(8.5%). Conclusion: Almost half of the older Thai adults chose a DNR status forscenarios in which they were infected with COVID-19 and suffered from cardiacarrest during the pandemic period. Future studies should include an in-depthexamination of participants' lifestyles, family life expectancy, and religiousfaith to understand their end-of-life decisions.

PG  - 98-104
LID - 10.1089/pmr.2021.0050 [doi]
AB  - Background: With the rapid progress of medical technology, the number of childrenwith medical complexities who require advanced medical care, including mechanicalventilators, has been increasing steadily in Japan. Accordingly, the issue of howto provide holistic care and support for the entire life of the children withsevere motor and intellectual disabilities (SMID) who live at home has become anew challenge. Case Presentation: We present the case of a three-year-old boywith SMID due to HHV-6B-induced hemorrhagic shock encephalopathy who was caredfor at home by the home visit medical team of Osaka Developmental Rehabilitation Center (ODRC; residential facilities with the department of home medicaltreatment and care). He developed septic shock triggered by an urinary tractinfection and was admitted to Osaka General Medical Center (OGMC; acute carefacility not directly affiliated with ODRC), where he deteriorated to a terminal stage. After discussing advance care planning (ACP) with his parents, along with the medical team, an ACP document with parental wishes was created throughcollaboration between the two facilities. The document was approved by the EthicsCommittee at OGMC and the parents signed the document. Special end-of-life careplanning was given by nurses at OGMC based on the best interests of the patientand the family. The patient passed away peacefully surrounded by his family in a private room of OGMC according to the ACP, despite special limitations caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Conclusions: ACP provides agood opportunity to think about the best total care for a child with SMID, forwhom it is too difficult to express his or her wishes, together with the parents,who are the legal representatives. The collaboration between two institutionswith different roles brought out the best of each, and the resulting ACP wasbeneficial to the patient and their family.

These compounds were obtained in good to excellentyields from 63 to 91% in the presence of 30 mol% catalyst in ethanol at refluxfor 2 h through an efficient one-pot three-component reaction including anintramolecular rearrangement and a cyclization through intramolecularnucleophilic reaction. The results of in silico studies showed thatelectronegativity, resonance effects, hydrophobic interaction, halogen andhydrogen bonding had significant effects on the performance of these compounds asan inhibitor ligand. Also, these results indicated the proper affinity of thesecompounds against the COVID-19 main protease with excellent binding energies(especially 4r = -8.77, 4q = -8.73 and 4m = -8.63) in comparison to remdesivir,chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir drugs.

PG  - 19327-19339
LID - 10.1039/d2ra02653h [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of research and development in maintaining public health. Facing unprecedented challenges, the scientificcommunity developed antiviral drugs, virucides, and vaccines to combat theinfection within the past two years. However, an ever-increasing list of highlyinfectious SARS-CoV-2 variants (gamma, delta, omicron, and now ba.2 stealth) has exacerbated the problem: again raising the issues of infection preventionstrategies and the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE). Against this backdrop, we report an antimicrobial fabric for PPE applications. We havefabricated a nanofibrous silk-PEO material using electrospinning followed by zincoxide thin film deposition by employing the atomic layer deposition technique.The composite fabric has shown 85% more antibacterial activity than the controlfabric and was found to possess substantial superoxide dismutase-mimeticactivity. The composite was further subjected to antiviral testing using twodifferent respiratory tract viruses: coronavirus (OC43: enveloped) and rhinovirus(RV14: non-enveloped). We report a 95% reduction in infectious virus for bothOC43 and RV14 from an initial load of approximately 1 x 10(5) (sample size: 6 mm dia. disk), after 1 h of white light illumination. Furthermore, with 2 h ofillumination, approximately 99% reduction in viral infectivity was observed forRV14. High activity in a relatively small area of fabric (3.5 x 10(3) viral unitsper mm(2)) makes this antiviral fabric ideal for application in masks/PPE, withan enhanced ability to prevent antimicrobial infection overall.

PG  - e26477
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26477 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has been one of the common infections that have affected numerouschildren across the world in the last two years. The clinical manifestations ofthis virus are varied, ranging from being asymptomatic to affecting multipleorgan systems. There is a lot of ongoing research to find out the differentmanifestations that this infection can have in both adults and children. As with any viral illness, skin is one of the most commonly affected organs, and manyviral illnesses can present with a rash. In our case, we found it interestingthat our patient who tested positive for COVID-19 had a rash that began on theday of her initial presentation and evolved over time as the disease progressed, and hence, we thought it was important to highlight this rare case presentationas a cutaneous finding in children with COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Scarcity and panic buying: the effect of regulation by subsidizing the supply andcustomer purchases during a crisis.
PG  - 1-26
LID - 10.1007/s10479-022-04837-7 [doi]
AB  - During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in France, people cleared theshelves of butter; in Italy, it was pasta; in Great Britain, it was chicken.While there may be cultural disagreement on what is essential, clearly, in times of crisis, consumers stockpile the 'essentials'. We address the problem of "panicbuying", which is characterized by increasing demand in the face of diminishinginventory. In such cases, prices may hike and firms (retailers) selling thehigh-demand product are quantity takers, in terms of supply, and price setters.We consider a manufacturer who sells a scarce product to a single retailer. Theretailer seeks to maximize her profit, while in contrast, the manufacturerpursues a social objective of regulating and lowering the amount that the endcustomer (consumer) pays (including the cost of traveling to obtain the scarceproduct). By analyzing the competition between the two parties, retailer andmanufacturer, we find that even when the regulator (manufacturer) makes asignificant social commitment, neither subsidizing the retailer nor subsidizingthe consumers necessarily curbs price hikes. Furthermore, there is a thresholdratio (i.e., proportion of the end price subsidized by the regulator) thatdetermines the minimal budget that the regulator would need to allocate in order for subsidization to make a difference to consumers.

TI  - Early recognition and treatment of pre-VITT syndrome after adenoviralvector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may prevent from thrombotic complications:review of published cases and clinical pathway.
PG  - oeac036
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac036 [doi]
AB  - Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but highlymorbid complication after adenoviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Thepre-VITT syndrome is defined as vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia withoutthrombosis typically presenting with new-onset headache. This review aims toidentify at-risk patients before complications such as cerebral venous sinusthrombosis occur. We review previously published reports of 19 patients (medianage 35 years, range 23-74; 16 females) who met the diagnostic criteria for apre-VITT syndrome. Seven patients progressed to VITT, 12 patients did not.Patients who experienced VITT received delayed treatment. The median intervalbetween the onset of headache and VITT-treatment (i.e. anticoagulation, immuneglobulins, or corticosteroids) was 5 days (range 1-8 days) compared with 2 days(0-5 days) in those without subsequent VITT (P = 0.033). The interval from onset of headache to anticoagulation was longer in patients with VITT (median 7 vs. 2days; range 3-9 vs. 0-7 days; P = 0.01). Anticoagulation was safe in all patientswith a pre-VITT syndrome as no haemorrhagic complications occurred afteranticoagulation was started despite low platelets. The transient decline ofplatelet count after admission was significantly more pronounced in patients who progressed to VITT (median 67 vs. 0 x 10(3)/microL; range 0-77 x 10(3)/microL vs.0-10 x 10(3)/microL; P = 0.005). d-dimers did not differ between groups. Pre-VITTsyndrome is a 'red flag' and allows to identify and preemptively treat patientsat-risk of further progression to VITT. However, it must be distinguished frompost-vaccination immune thrombocytopenia.

AB  - We analyse the recent policy decisions made by the European Central Bank and the national authorities related to capital and shareholders' remuneration aimed atpromoting banking credit supply in COVID-19-afflicted economies. We forecast the impact of the regulatory decisions based on the empirical literature and discuss the factors that reduce the banks' incentives to expand their loan portfolios. Weargue that the introduction of the dividend ban caused a surge in regulatoryuncertainty and undermined banks' market valuation raising the expected fundingcosts and contributing to the banks' reluctance to make use of the capitalbuffers. We develop policy suggestions intended to mitigate this effect.

LID - 10.34172/jcs.2022.14 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak is a health emergency, in which health carepersonnel (HCP) face psychological consequences, working as frontline workers.Therefore, we conducted this study to find out associated psychological impactsamong HCP during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This systematic review follows thePreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)guideline. The reviewed studies were searched from PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL andGoogle scholar electronic database using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH)terms. Results: We searched through 2676 articles, 19 of which were finallyincluded, most of them were cross-sectional and descriptive studies with 12910participants. HCP were found to be exposed to a variety of psychologicalproblems; anxiety symptoms were reported in 33% (3081 of 9269), depression 28%(2681 of 9487), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 41% (2933 of 7167), sleepproblems 26% (903 of 3442), stress 13% (487 of 3496) and fear 67.3% (392 of 582).The severity of impacts was often mild to moderate. The nurses were twice aslikely to develop these symptoms. The factors associated with psychologicalimpacts were fear of infection to self and family members, lack of resources and facilities at workplace, demanding work conditions, working closely with COVID-19clients in intensive care unit and pre-existing medical and psychologicalproblems. Conclusion: Psychological impacts was mild to moderate among majorityof HCP during COVID-19 pandemic. The outcome of this review is to provide someutilitarian information for making supportive policies and strategies to improve the psychological wellbeing of frontline HCP during this pandemic.

TI  - The COVID-19 pandemic's effects on SMEs and travel agencies: The critical role ofcorporate social responsibility.
LID - 10.1016/j.eap.2022.07.008 [doi]
AB  - This study is based on the system resilience framework, which outlines theaspects of community behavior, employees, the environment, history, and corporatesocial responsibility. We used a partial least squares structural equation model to evaluate a sample of 300 Vietnamese SMEs and travel agencies. We discoveredthat SMEs' strategies positively influence performance and are co-created withcorporate social responsibility. The dependability of internal integrity was thendetermined. The empirical results showed that the overall confidence index forall facilities ranged from 0.70 to 0.95, with values ranging from 0.809 to 0.931.Furthermore, the A and Cronbach's alpha reliability values ranged from 0.70 to0.90. As a result, the reliability of internal consistency was established. Theconvergence validity of the configurations was assessed by comparing theextracted mean values of variance (AVE), which, for all configurations, exceeded the limit of 0.50. This approach emphasizes the impact of corporate socialresponsibility practices on communities, the environment, and heritage.

AB  - In Cote d'Ivoire, a country of 28 million inhabitants in West Africa, a surveyconducted by the Ministry of the Family in 2018 showed the extent of gender-basedviolence (GBV) in the Greater Abidjan area (5 million inhabitants), the country'seconomic capital. The social workers employed for this work were mobilized duringthe Covid-19 pandemic to raise awareness and help the population fight againstSARS-CoV-2. The results collected by these workers during the first period(January 2019 - February 2020) and the second period (March 2020 - April 2021)are the subject of this article.From the first period to the second, the numberof rapes increased from 41 to 77, sexual assaults from 4 to 7, physical assaults from 139 to 171, and forced marriages from 4 to 7. In total, the social workershelped 303 victims during the pre-pandemic period and 402 during the pandemic.This evolution varies from municipality to municipality in the Greater Abidjanarea, and is not related to the number of inhabitants per municipality andwithout any link with the frequency of Covid-19 in each municipality. Despitepossible biases, this study highlights a major health problem, GBV, anddemonstrates the probable negative effects of the pandemic.

AB  - Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an underdiagnosed cause of acutecoronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. During thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome(MIS) emerged that is incompletely understood. While the involvement of numerous organ systems has been described, the potential cardiovascular manifestations,such as myocarditis, arterial thrombosis, or SCAD, are particularly worrisome.Here, we present a case of MIS that was preceded by an unremarkable case ofCOVID-19 and followed by the development of SCAD. This case highlights theimportance of furthering our understanding of the potential sequelae of COVID-19 and of the potential relationship between SCAD and MIS.

TI  - The Impact of the Highly Virulent SARS-CoV-2 Gamma Variant on Young Adults in theState of Sao Paulo: Was It Inevitable?
PG  - e26486
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26486 [doi]
AB  - Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had and is stillhaving a tremendous impact on people all over the world, but it has beenparticularly harsh in South America. Nine out of 13 South American countries are among the 50 countries with the highest COVID-19 death rates. The gamma severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant that emerged by theend of 2020 in the Brazilian Amazon quickly spread throughout the country causingthe harsh COVID-19 second wave. This variant displayed high viral loads, hightransmissibility, and increased virulence as compared to previous variants. Aims The aim of this retrospective study is to revisit and analyse the epidemiology ofthe COVID-19 second wave in the state of Sao Paulo, the most populous Brazilianstate. In addition to examining the possible factors that led to the emergenceand propagation of the gamma variant, measures that could have prevented itsspread and that of other highly virulent variants were also investigated.Materials and methods Data from Sao Paulo's official sources on morbidity,mortality, age distribution, and testing prior to and during the COVID-19 second wave (February - June 2021) and data regarding the distribution of SARS-CoV-2variants in the country were parsed, analyzed, and compared to the period thatanteceded the eruption of the second COVID-19 wave. Results In the state of SaoPaulo, the toll of the COVID-19 second wave surpassed that of the first 11 monthsof the pandemic (from March 2020 to January 2021), as 56% of the deaths occurred in the five months of the second wave between February and June 2021. The meanage of COVID-19 victims, which was already below life expectancy in the statedropped even further in the pandemic's second wave, reaching an average of 60years of age. The years of life lost per death per month doubled and thecase-fatality rate (CFR) of young adults (20-39 years old) more than trebledduring this period. A number of hypotheses have been raised that might explainthe emergence and spread of the gamma variant and the measures that could havebeen taken to prevent it and minimise its impact on the population. ConclusionsOver 142,000 people died as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma variant sweep in SaoPaulo in the first semester of 2021. Due to its high viral load, the gammavariant displayed high transmissibility and a high degree of virulence resulting in increased case fatality rates across most age tiers. Notably, this second wavewas marked by a very significant increase in deaths among young adults. Thisincrease was at least partially due to a deterioration in general health provokedby non-pharmaceutical interventions. In hindsight, a safer and more effectivemeasure might have been to allow the free spread of the virus among the young andhealthy in the first wave, thus conferring immunity against more virulentvariants that emerged later on.

PG  - e26493
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26493 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has become one of the main causes of febrile illness among emergencydepartment patients and is always a differential diagnosis to keep in mind.Nonetheless, some patients with a history of exposure, persistent fever, andsuspicion of COVID-19 end up having entirely different etiologies. Here, wepresent the case of a 29-year-old male biologist with an uncommon presentation ofa zoonotic disease, characterized by unspecific signs and symptoms, which led to a delayed diagnosis, causing significant emotional distress in the patient. Wealso coin the term "COVID-19 Mirage," to serve as a constant reminder forclinicians of the effect that COVID-19 has caused on the differential diagnosisof fever of unknown etiology.

TI  - Living donor liver transplant outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: does adecrease in case volume impact the overall outcomes?
PG  - 127-135
LID - 10.4285/kjt.22.0017 [doi]
AB  - Background: High-volume centers (HVCs) are classically associated with betteroutcomes. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has beena decrease in the regular liver transplantation (LT) activity at our center. Thisstudy analyzed the effect of the decline in LT on posttransplant patient outcomesat our HVC. Methods: We compared the surgical outcomes of patients who underwent LT during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (April 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020)with outcomes in the pre-pandemic calendar year (April 1, 2019 to March 31,2020). Results: During the 6 months of pandemic lockdown, 60 patients underwentLT (43 adults and 17 children) while 228 patients underwent LT (178 adults and 50children) during the pre-pandemic calendar year. Patients in the pandemic grouphad significantly higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores(24.39+/-9.55 vs. 21.14+/-9.17, P=0.034), Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores(11.46+/-2.32 vs. 10.25+/-2.24, P=0.03), and incidence of acute-on-chronic liver failure (30.2% vs. 10.2%, P=0.002). Despite performing LT in sicker patients withCOVID-19-related challenges, the 30-day (14% vs. 18.5%, P=0.479), 3-month (16.3% vs. 20.2%, P=0.557), and 6-month mortality rates (23.3% vs. 28.7%, P=0.477) were lower, but not statistically significant when compared to the pre-pandemiccohort. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown the number of LTprocedures performed at our HVC declined by half because prevailing conditionsallowed LT in very sick patients only. Despite these changes, outcomes were notinferior during the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic calendar year.Greater individualization of patient care contributed to non-inferior outcomes inthese sick recipients.

TI  - Takotsubo syndrome and respiratory diseases: a systematic review.
PG  - oeac009
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac009 [doi]
AB  - Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a rare cardiovascular condition characterized byreversible ventricular dysfunction and a presentation resembling that of acutemyocardial infarction. An increasing number of studies has shown the association of respiratory diseases with TTS. Here, we comprehensively reviewed theliterature and examined the available evidence for this association. Aftersearching PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, two investigatorsindependently reviewed 3117 studies published through May 2021. Of these studies,99 met the inclusion criteria (n = 108 patients). In patients with coexistingrespiratory disease and TTS, the most common TTS symptom was dyspnoea (70.48%),followed by chest pain (24.76%) and syncope (2.86%). The most common type of TTS was apical, accounting for 81.13% of cases, followed by the midventricular(8.49%), basal (8.49%), and biventricular (1.89%) types. Among the TTS cases,39.82% were associated with obstructive lung disease and 38.89% were associatedwith pneumonia. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been increasingly reported in patients with TTS, was identified in 29 of 42 (69.05%) patients with pneumonia. The overall mortality rate for patients admitted for respiratorydisease complicated by TTS was 12.50%. Obstructive lung disease and pneumonia arethe most frequently identified respiratory triggers of TTS. Medications andinvasive procedures utilized in managing respiratory diseases may also contributeto the development of TTS. Furthermore, the diagnosis of TTS triggered by theseconditions can be challenging due to its atypical presentation. Futureprospective studies are needed to establish appropriate guidelines for managingrespiratory disease with concurrent TTS.

PG  - 341
LID - 10.12688/f1000research.109398.2 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study aims to identify the preferred sources for acquiringknowledge about COVID-19 and to evaluate basic knowledge on critical scientificliterature appraisal in students from medical schools located in Spanish speakingcountries in Latin America. Methods: We designed an online survey of 15closed-ended questions related to demographics, preferred resources for COVID-19 training, and items to assess critical appraisal skills. A snowball method wasused for sampling. We conducted a descriptive analysis and Chi-squared tests tocompare the proportion of correct identification of the concept of a preprint anda predatory journal when considering a) self-perceived level of knowledge, b)public vs private school, c) inclusion of a scientific literature appraisalsubject in the curriculum, and d) progress in medical school. Results: Our sampleincluded 770 valid responses, out of which most of the participants included werefrom Mexico (n=283, 36.8%) and Ecuador (n=229, 29.7%). Participants preferredusing evidence-based clinical resources (EBCRs) to learn more about COVID-19(n=182, 23.6%). The preferred study design was case report/series (n=218, 28.1%).We found that only 265 participants correctly identified the concept of apreprint (34.4%), while 243 students (31.6%) correctly identified thecharacteristics of a predatory journal. We found no significant differences inthe proportion of correct answers regardless of the self-perceived level ofknowledge, progress in medical school, or scientific literature criticalappraisal classes. Conclusion: This study is novel in its approach of identifyingsources of knowledge used by Latin American medical students and providesinsights into the need to reinforce training in critical appraisal of scientific literature during medical school.

AB  - Background: Managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using availableresources is essential to reduce the health burden of disease. The severity ofCOVID-19 is affected by nutritional status. In this study the effect of naturalproduct use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity andhospitalization was explored. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Between March and July 2021, a self-administered survey was conducted in Jordan.Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and were >/=18 years old were the studypopulation. Study measures included the use of natural products, COVID-19severity, and hospitalization status. A multivariate regression model was usedfor statistical analysis. Results: The mean age (mean +/- SD) of the study sample(n=2,148) was 40.25 +/- 15.58 years old. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the regular intake of carnation (OR [0.56], CI [0.37-0.85]), onion (OR[0.69], CI [0.52-0.92]), lemon (OR [0.68], CI [0.51-0.90]), and citrus fruits (OR[0.66], CI [0.50-0.89]) before infection were associated with a substantialreduction in COVID-19 severity (P<0.01). Also, the consumption of carnation (OR[0.55], CI [0.34-0.88]), lemon (OR [0.57], CI [0.42-0.78]), and citrus fruits (OR[0.61], CI [0.44-0.84]) were associated with a significant decrease in thefrequency of COVID-19-induced hospitalization (P<0.01). Conclusions: Regularconsumption of carnation, lemon, and citrus fruits before infection wasassociated with better outcomes for COVID-19. Studies on other populations arerequired to confirm these findings.

AB  - We report herein a case series of infants, with no comorbidities, who developed alife-threatening illness due to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children, aged under 15 years, admitted to PICU, during the peak of Delta infection, between June 23 and August 16 2021, withsevere and critical forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by RT-PCR. Twentyinfants were included, the median age was 47 days (IQR: 26.5-77) and sex ratiowas 0.8. No underlying medical conditions were noted. Parents were notvaccinated. Respiratory involvement was the main feature observed. Elevenpatients had paediatric acute respiratory distress (PARDS) with a median oxygensaturation index (OSI) of 9 (IQR: 7-11). PARDS was mild in four, moderate infive, and severe in two cases. Hemodynamic instability was observed in 4 cases.The main radiological finding was ground glass opacities in 11 cases. Seventeenpatients were mechanically ventilated, and three of them were escalated tohigh-frequency oscillatory ventilation. The median duration of mechanicalventilation was 6 days (IQR 2.5-12.5). The remaining patients were managed withhigh-flow nasal cannula. Four patients died.

AB  - Background: The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness ofultra-low-dose (ULD) chest computed tomography (CT) in comparison with theroutine dose (RD) CT images in detecting lung lesions related to COVID-19.Methods: A prospective study was conducted during April-September 2020 at Shahid Faghihi Hospital affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz,Iran. In total, 273 volunteers with suspected COVID-19 participated in the study and successively underwent RD-CT and ULD-CT chest scans. Two expert radiologists qualitatively evaluated the images. Dose assessment was performed by determining volume CT dose index, dose length product, and size-specific dose estimate. Data analysis was performed using a ranking test and kappa coefficient (kappa). P<0.05was considered statistically significant. Results: Lung lesions could be detectedwith both RD-CT and ULD-CT images in patients with suspected or confirmedCOVID-19 (kappa=1.0, P=0.016). The estimated effective dose for the RD-CTprotocol was 22-fold higher than in the ULD-CT protocol. In the case of theULD-CT protocol, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictivevalue for the detection of consolidation were 60%, 83%, 80%, and 20%,respectively. Comparably, in the case of RD-CT, these percentages for thedetection of ground-glass opacity (GGO) were 62%, 66%, 66%, and 18%,respectively. Assuming the result of real-time polymerase chain reaction astrue-positive, analysis of the receiver-operating characteristic curve for GGOdetected using the ULD-CT protocol showed a maximum area under the curve of 0.78.Conclusion: ULD-CT, with 94% dose reduction, can be an alternative to RD-CT todetect lung lesions for COVID-19 diagnosis and follow-up.An earlier preliminaryreport of a similar work with a lower sample size was submitted to the arXive as a preprint.

AB  - Background: Effective measures to control COVID-19 should be based on anunderstanding of its epidemiological pattern and the evaluation of its prevalencein the community. This study aimed to examine the reproductive number (R) ofCOVID-19 and its trend in Fars Province in southern Iran. Methods: In thisecological study, the R trend was examined from July to November 2020. Data were collected from the daily reports of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. R isthe product of three components, namely the number of infection-producingcontacts per unit time, the probability of transmission per contact, and thecontagiousness period. Incidence and prevalence rates were used to calculate R.The R value was calculated in Microsoft Excel 2016. Results: The first and secondpeaks of COVID-19 were observed on July 6(th) and November 22(nd), respectively. The median and mean of R were 1.42 and 1.41, respectively. The highest and lowestvalues of R were observed on October 20(th) (2.60) and September 1(st) (0.46),respectively. The values of R had a slightly decreasing trend in the second half of July and November than the first half. In the second half of August andSeptember, an increasing trend was observed than the first half. There was notmuch change in the second half of October. Conclusion: The highest value of R wasrelated to the dates when there was a higher probability of exposure to thevirus, including public holidays and different occasions on which the probabilityof people's participation in ceremonies, communities, and gatherings was higher.

AB  - For a while, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been a major globalpandemic. It primarily affects the respiratory system but has extrapulmonarymanifestations such as gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. Data onmyasthenia gravis (MG), as a complication of COVID-19, are limited. We hereinreport the manifestation of ocular MG as an initial symptom of COVID-19. InNovember 2020, a 31-year-old healthy woman was referred to Firoozgar Hospital(Tehran, Iran) with left upper eyelid ptosis and diplopia as well as generalweakness, myalgia, fever, and nasal congestion for four days prior to admission. Although the acetylcholine receptor antibody in her serum was negative, increasedjitter in several muscles led to the diagnosis of ocular MG. Nasal swab reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay tested positive for severeacute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Computedtomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities andsome foci of consolidation formation, but the thymus was normal. The patient was successfully treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. The patient waseventually discharged in good condition and with improved neurological symptoms. A limited number of studies have suggested a possible association between MG and COVID-19. Therefore, further data are required to substantiate the proposedassociation. Clinicians should be aware of ocular MG during the COVID-19 pandemicto better diagnose and manage patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - In December 2019, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak emerged inWuhan, China. The World Health Organization officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Reports indicated that the associated mortality of the infection is quite higher in the elderly, individuals with specific comorbidities (such as diabetes mellitus), and generally the ones with a compromised immune system. Acohort study in Wuhan, China, reported a dysregulated immune response in 452patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. As a result of this suppressedimmune response, an increase in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, T lymphopenia,and a decrease in CD4(+) T cells were all common laboratory findings, especially in severe cases. On the other hand, there is substantial evidence of T cellexhaustion in critically ill patients. Accordingly, the immune system seems toplay an important role in the prognosis and pathogenesis of the disease.Therefore, this study aims to review the evidence on the immune responsedysregulation in COVID-19 infection and the potential role of immunoregulatorytreatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, interferons, and CD200inhibitors in altering disease prognosis, especially in critically ill patients.

TI  - A wavelet-based deep learning pipeline for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis via CTslices.
PG  - 109401
LID - 10.1016/j.asoc.2022.109401 [doi]
AB  - The quick diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is vital toprevent its propagation and improve therapeutic outcomes. Computed tomography(CT) is believed to be an effective tool for diagnosing COVID-19, however, the CTscan contains hundreds of slices that are complex to be analyzed and could cause delays in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) especially deep learning (DL), could facilitate and speed up COVID-19 diagnosis from such scans. Several studiesemployed DL approaches based on 2D CT images from a single view, nevertheless, 3Dmultiview CT slices demonstrated an excellent ability to enhance the efficiencyof COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of DL-based studies utilized the spatialinformation of the original CT images to train their models, though, usingspectral-temporal information could improve the detection of COVID-19. Thisarticle proposes a DL-based pipeline called CoviWavNet for the automaticdiagnosis of COVID-19. CoviWavNet uses a 3D multiview dataset called OMNIAHCOV.Initially, it analyzes the CT slices using multilevel discrete waveletdecomposition (DWT) and then uses the heatmaps of the approximation levels totrain three ResNet CNN models. These ResNets use the spectral-temporalinformation of such images to perform classification. Subsequently, itinvestigates whether the combination of spatial information withspectral-temporal information could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. For this purpose, it extracts deep spectral-temporal features from such ResNetsusing transfer learning and integrates them with deep spatial features extracted from the same ResNets trained with the original CT slices. Then, it utilizes afeature selection step to reduce the dimension of such integrated features anduse them as inputs to three support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further validate the performance of CoviWavNet, a publicly available benchmark datasetcalled SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan is employed. The results of CoviWavNet havedemonstrated that using the spectral-temporal information of the DWT heatmapimages to train the ResNets is superior to utilizing the spatial information ofthe original CT images. Furthermore, integrating deep spectral-temporal features with deep spatial features has enhanced the classification accuracy of the three SVM classifiers reaching a final accuracy of 99.33% and 99.7% for the OMNIAHCOVand SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan datasets respectively. These accuracies verify theoutstanding performance of CoviWavNet compared to other related studies. Thus,CoviWavNet can help radiologists in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis.

METHODS: We reviewed echocardiography findings of all multi-systeminflammatory syndrome cases between 1st April and 31st July, 2020 and typicalKawasaki disease patients with coronary arteries abnormalities consecutivelyfollowed between 1st October, 2016 and June 30th, 2019. RESULTS: We included 40multi-system inflammatory syndrome children (25 males, 62.5%) and 45 Kawasakidisease patients (31 males, 68.9%) at a mean age of 6.4 years old and 8 yearsold, respectively. Four out of 40 multi-system inflammatory syndrome children hadcoronary arteries abnormalities. Left ventricle ejection fraction was normal inboth groups. Global longitudinal strain was normal although Kawasaki diseasegroup had significantly lower values (-20.0 versus -21.7%; p = 0.02). Basalsegments were the most affected in Kawasaki disease patients with significantdifferences in the basal anterior, anterolateral, and anteroseptal strain: -18.2 versus -23.0% (p = 0.002), -16.7 versus -22.0% (p < 0.001), -16.7 versus -19.5%(p = 0.034), respectively. The basal anterolateral and anteroseptal segments inKawasaki disease patients were the only ones with an absolute reduction oflongitudinal strain (-16.7% both) consistent with the greater left main coronary involvement in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with thetransient cardiac involvement in multi-system inflammatory syndrome, as opposedto the subtle and chronic myocardial involvement in Kawasaki disease childrenwith coronary arteries abnormalities. We speculate that the mechanism of cardiac impairment in the few multi-system inflammatory syndrome children with reducedglobal longitudinal strain is not related to coronary arteries abnormalities.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine humoral response in frequent platelet donors withplateletpheresis-associated lymphopenia.
LID - 10.1111/trf.17037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plateletpheresis involves platelet separation and collection fromwhole blood while other blood cells are returned to the donor. Because platelets are replaced faster than red blood cells, as many as 24 donations can be doneannually. However, some frequent apheresis platelet donors (>20 donationsannually) display severe plateletpheresis-associated lymphopenia; in particular, CD4(+) T but not B cell numbers are decreased. COVID-19 vaccination therebyprovides a model to assess whether lymphopenic platelet donors presentcompromised humoral immune responses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessedvaccine responses following 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccination in a cohort of 43plateletpheresis donors with a range of pre-vaccination CD4(+) T cell counts(76-1537 cells/mul). In addition to baseline T cell measurements, antibodybinding assays to full-length Spike and the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) wereperformed pre- and post-vaccination. Furthermore, pseudo-particle neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays were conducted to measureantibody functionality. RESULTS: Participants were stratified into two groups:<400 CD4/mul (n = 27) and >/= 400 CD4/mul (n = 16). Following the first dose, 79%seroconverted within the <400 CD4/mul group compared to 87% in the >/=400 CD4/mulgroup; all donors were seropositive post-second dose with significant increasesin antibody levels. Importantly differences in CD4(+) T cell levels minimallyimpacted neutralization, Spike recognition, and IgG Fc-mediated effectorfunctions. DISCUSSION: Overall, our results indicate that lymphopenicplateletpheresis donors do not exhibit significant immune dysfunction; they have retained the T and B cell functionality necessary for potent antibody responsesafter vaccination.

TI  - Older people's experience of COVID-19 restrictions on vaccine hesitancy: Alongitudinal phenomenological study to support nurse-patient vaccinationconversations.
LID - 10.1111/jan.15398 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore how older people's experiences of COVID-19 restrictionsinfluenced their decision to receive a vaccine and to support nurse-patientvaccination conversations. DESIGN: A longitudinal hermeneutic phenomenologicalstudy. The application of the COREQ checklist informed the reporting of thisstudy. METHODS: Data were collected through semi-structured telephone interviews with older people (age >/=70) during two national restrictions implemented inEngland due to COVID-19. Phase one of interviews occurred between April and July 2020 (six interviews), and phase two of interviews between January and April 2021(four interviews). Data analysis was performed through content analysis. RESULTS:Thirteen older people (mean age 78) worked through six stages about theirthoughts and beliefs about receiving a vaccine, which encompassed four of thefive elements of the 5C model of vaccine hesitancy, confidence, convenience,calculation, collective, but not complacency. Stages included 'our only hope is avaccine'; 'understanding and acceptance of an effective vaccine'; 'socialresponsibility to protect others'; 'organized but left with unansweredquestions'; 'need to feel secure' and finally 'vaccination alone is not enough'. CONCLUSION: The experience of COVID-19 restrictions by older people informedtheir approach of engaging with scientific information to inform their decisions to be vaccinated but also developed their sense of collective responsibility toyounger generations and those at risk, which informed their adherence torestrictions and the vaccination programme. IMPACT: Nurses are optimally placedto support older people to implement and adhere to national governmentrestrictions as appropriate and prevent obsessive routines, and supportdiscussions and the provision of scientific information on COVID-19 vaccinations,whilst being inclusive of older peoples' sense of collective responsibility.

AB  - A 43-year-old male patient presented with acute blurring of vision in both eyesassociated with photophobia, redness, and mild pain following coronavirus disease2019 (Covid-19) infection. Clinical examination revealed extensive pigmentdusting in the corneal endothelium and the trabecular meshwork withde-pigmentation bands in the iris periphery. The patient was managed empirically with topical anti-glaucoma medications for high intra-ocular pressure. Thepatient was prescribed systemic antibiotics including cephalosporins andamoxicillin for respiratory symptoms. A rare condition called bilateral acutede-pigmentation of iris (BADI) was suspected after ruling out common entities,for example, viral kerato-uveitis, pigment dispersion syndrome, and Fuchsiridocyclitis. Covid-19 infection and systemic antibiotics includingcephalosporins have shown to cause BADI in the literature. The patient responded well with good outcome.

AB  - This report shows a case of corneal transplant rejection after vaccinationagainst severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), short afterreceiving the BNT162b2 vaccine, in a patient who had undergone keratoplasty more than 20 years ago, with no previous episodes of rejection and no other factorthat could lead to the findings on his examinations. After treatment with highdoses of topic, oral, and sub-conjunctival corticoids, the patient had afavorable therapeutic response. The signs of corneal transplant rejection must beoriented to the patients and the causing factors actively searched byophthalmologists so that treatment is rapidly initiated and sequels are avoided. This report raises the question if these events are correlated and whether thepatient should receive the second dose of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 or not.

PG  - 3096-3101
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_448_22 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Amidst the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Indiaexperienced an epidemic of COVID-19-associated rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis(ROCM). This study aimed to describe the epidemiology and elucidate the riskfactors for developing COVID-19-associated ROCM, comparing the risk factors amongCOVID-19 patients with and without ROCM. Methods: This case-control studyincluded all COVID-19-associated ROCM patients treated at our hospital from May 1to July 30, 2021. Controls included age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patientswithout ROCM, who were treated during the same time (exact matching, in 1:2ratio). Matched pair analysis using conditional logistic regression was performedto examine the association of various risk factors with the development of ROCMin COVID-19 patients. Results: The study included 69 patients withCOVID-19-associated ROCM and 138 age- and gender-matched controls.Epidemiologically, COVID-19-associated ROCM predominantly affected males (59/69, 85%), in their early 50s (mean 52 years), with 48% (33/69) of patients being frommedical resource-constrained settings. On multivariate conditional logisticregression, elevated serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36,95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.78), blood glucose (OR = 1.008, 95% CI:1.003-1.013), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.17) wereassociated with increased odds of developing COVID-19-associated ROCM. Patientswith undetected diabetes mellitus with increasing HbA1c (OR = 3.42, 95% CI:1.30-9.02) and blood glucose (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.005-1.03) (P = 0.02) had ahigher probability of developing COVID-19-associated ROCM than patients withestablished DM. Conclusion: Uncontrolled DM evidenced by elevated HbA1c and bloodglucose levels, exacerbated by COVID-19-induced proinflammatory state indicatedby elevated CRP, is the principal independent risk factor for COVID-19-associatedROCM. Middle-aged males with undetected DM, from a resource-constraint setting,are particularly at risk.

PG  - 3040-3044
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_40_22 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Novel coronavirus has brought huge changes in lifestyle, especiallyamong children. Reports indicate that the prevalence of refractive errors amongchildren has increased due to home confinement. Hence, this study was done tounderstand the current status of refractive errors among children from publicschools in southern India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted aspart of school eye screening conducted between September and October 2021.Children between 14 and 17 years of age from public schools underwent athree-phased comprehensive eye examination. Children identified with refractiveerrors and an equal proportion of children without any refractive errorsunderwent a survey on outdoor activities. Prevalence estimates and 95% confidenceinterval were calculated. Chi-square tests and regression analysis were used tounderstand the association between refractive error and other variables. Results:From the data of 3,850 (90.69%) children, the prevalence of vision impairment,refractive errors, and myopia in at least one eye was found to be 12.83% (n =494), 21.51% (n = 828), and 19.53% (n = 752), respectively. The average myopicspherical equivalent error was found to be -2.17 +/- 1.11D (range:-0.50 D to-14.00 D). Almost 96.82% of girls had less than 3 h of outdoor activities.Refractive errors were 7.42 and 2.77 times more (95% CI: 3.51-15.70), P < 0.001) among children who had outdoor activities less than 3 h per day and sleep lessthan 7 h per day. Conclusion: Comparing to previous studies from North Indian andSouth Indian public schools, this study reports a three- to six-fold rise inmyopia post-home confinement among public school children from India.

TI  - Burnout and impostor phenomenon in nursing and newly licensed registered nurses: A scoping review.
LID - 10.1111/jocn.16475 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence and severity of impostorphenomenon and burnout in newly licensed registered nurses, map the currentliterature on impostor phenomenon in nursing, and identify related factorsaffecting the new nurse's transition to practice. BACKGROUND: Impostor phenomenonis an internalised intellectual phoniness resulting in persistent self-doubtdespite prior success. It can evoke feelings of emotional exhaustion associatedwith burnout, negatively affecting employee retention. Due to changes in nursing education resulting from COVID-19, self-doubt and uncertainty among new nursesare expected to be heightened, leading to burnout which adversely effects nursewell-being, patient care and retention. DESIGN: The scoping review follows themethodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and theReporting Checklist for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. METHODS: Theliterature search was conducted utilising PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Inclusion criteria were studies published between 2011 and 2021, written in English,peer-reviewed, and focused on newly licensed registered nurses. Eighteen articleswere reviewed. RESULTS: Studies on impostor phenomenon in nursing are limited to nursing students and clinical nurse specialists. Prevalence of impostor feelings in these populations range from 36% to 75%, and 12.3% to 46% of new nurses reportburnout. Impostor feelings arise from role ambiguity, lack of self-compassion,transitions, and minimal clinical experience. Burnout was associated with stress,feeling unprepared, inadequate socialisation, and lack of self-compassion.Overlap in these factors could increase impostor feelings and burnout in newnurses. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of impostor phenomenon and burnout can negativelyimpact the well-being of the new nurse. Currently, no studies simultaneouslyexamine impostor phenomenon and burnout in new nurses. Further research on therelationship between these phenomena should be conducted. RELEVANCE TO CLINICALPRACTICE: Understanding the impact of impostor phenomenon and burnout on newnurses could help mitigate challenges they face transitioning into practice.

TI  - Increased Body Mass Index and Metabolic Syndrome Are Associated with PoorOutcomes in SARS-CoV-2-Positive Emergency Department Patients.
LID - 10.7570/jomes22011 [doi]
AB  - Background: Increased body mass index (BMI) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) havebeen associated with adverse outcomes in viral syndromes. We sought to examineassociations of increased BMI and MetS on several clinical outcomes in patientstested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods:The REgistry of potential COVID-19 in emERgency care (RECOVER) is anobservational study of SARS-CoV-2-tested patients (n=27,051) across 155 USemergency departments (EDs). We used multivariable logistic regression to testfor associations of several predictor variables with various clinical outcomes.Results: We found that a BMI >/=30 kg/m(2) increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 testpositivity (odds ratio [OR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.38),while MetS reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR, 0.76; 95% CI,0.71-0.82). Adjusted multivariable analysis found that MetS was significantlyassociated with the need for admission (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.89-2.37), intensivecare unit (ICU) care (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.40-1.78), intubation (OR, 1.46; 95% CI,1.28-1.66), mortality (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.13-1.48), and venous thromboembolism(OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.07-2.13) in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Similarly, BMI>/=40 kg/m(2) was significantly associated with ICU care (OR, 1.97; 95% CI,1.65-2.35), intubation (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 2.22-3.26), and mortality (OR, 1.50;95% CI, 1.22-1.84). Conclusion: In this large nationwide sample of ED patients,we report a significant association of both high BMI and composite MetS with pooroutcomes in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Findings suggest that composite MetSprofile may be a more universal predictor of adverse disease outcomes, while the impact of BMI is more heavily modulated by SARS-CoV-2 status.

LID - 10.1002/brb3.2730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Domestic violence against women is a hidden and global epidemic that has many negative effects. The COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine, and staying at homecan lead to violent and domestic violence against women. Due to the importance ofthe subject, the present study was conducted to investigate the coping strategiesand resilience of women victims of domestic violence in the COVID-19 epidemic in Tehran, 2020. METHODS: The present study is a descriptive-analytical study on 420women who suffered domestic violence in Tehran, 2020. Data collection toolsincluded a demographic information form, socioeconomic status questionnaire, WHO standardized domestic violence questionnaire, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale,and Endler and Parker's coping strategies questionnaire. This study was based on the Internet and online. The research poster, the characteristics of theparticipants, the voluntary participation in the study, the confidentiality ofthe information, and the link to the online questionnaire were made publicthrough Internet networks. RESULTS: There was no correlation between resiliencewith general violence (p =.221), types of physical violence (p =.502),psychological violence (p =.178), and sexual violence (p =.386). The results alsoshowed that there was a statistically significant difference between the womenwho were using or not using a problem-oriented style with physical violence,using or not using an emotion-oriented style with physical, psychological, sexualviolence, and using or not using an avoidance style with physical violence among the samples (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The use of coping strategies leads to areduction in domestic violence against women during the COVID-19 pandemic.Therefore, designing and implementing training programs to improve coping styles in women can be effective in dealing with such stressful situations and helpprevent injuries caused by violence.

PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/17518423.2022.2099996 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined feasibility, acceptability, and preliminaryefficacy of a telepsychological positive parenting intervention(I-InTERACT-North, Internet-basedInteracting Together Everyday: Recovery AfterChildhood Traumatic Brain Injury) during the COVID-19 pandemic among Canadianfamilies of children at-risk for neurodevelopmental challenges given congenitalor neonatal conditions. I-InTERACT-North was developed to improve behavioral and emotional outcomes in children with neurological conditions by utilizing andadapting parenting strategies from several established family-focused programmes.METHODS: A pragmatic prospective pre-post single-site pilot study design was usedto assess feasibility, acceptabilty, and preliminary efficacy of I-InTERACT Northduring the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Thirty-five families of children agesthree to nine years were referred between March 2020 and January 2021. Eighteenfamilies enrolled, and 12 (67% adherence) completed the programme. Parentsreported strong therapeutic alliance and programme acceptability with barriersdue to competing time demands. Therapists reported high acceptability butperceived parental burnout. Parenting confidence (d = 0.70), and child behavior(d = 1.30) improved following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate the programme's value to families during the pandemic, while underscoring unique participation barriers. Future research and clinicial implications are discussed.

TI  - PEDOT:PSS in Solution Form Exhibits Strong Potential in Inhibiting SARS-CoV-2Infection of the Host Cells by Targeting Viruses and Also the Host Cells.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00271 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic with over 5 million fatalities. Vaccines against this virus have beenglobally administered; however, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein mutations are continuously identified with strong capability to escape vaccine-elicitedprotection. Due to the high mutation rate and transmission ability, thedevelopment of a broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor is highly in demand. In thisstudy, the effect of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS) against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated. The treatment of pseudovirusescarrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with PEDOT:PSS strongly blocked SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in human ACE2-expressing cells without causingcytotoxicity. Specifically, PEDOT:PSS showed great potential in both inactivatingviruses and rendering antiviral activity to the treated cells. The effects ofother PEDOT:PSS solutions with different chemical ratios and properties were alsovalidated to find the high inhibition capacity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirusinfection. The transcriptomic data reveal that PEDOT:PSS-treated cells wereendowed with transcriptional alteration, and it could be reverted after theremoval of PEDOT:PSS from the culture medium. Importantly, PEDOT:PSS alsoexhibited broad-spectrum inhibition effects on the pseudovirus carrying the spikeprotein isolated from different variants. In combination with the advantage ofhigh biocompatibility, PEDOT:PSS could thus be considered a potential therapeuticand prophylactic material against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Optimizing chronic pain management through patient engagement with quality oflife measures: a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 10.1515/jom-2021-0296 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) represents a new approach forguiding chronic pain management because it is patient-centered and more likely tobe understood and accepted by patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess the value andutility of an eHealth intervention for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP)that was primarily based on HRQOL measures and to measure the clinical outcomesassociated with its use. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conductedwithin the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and InterventionalStudies and Innovation (PRECISION Pain Research Registry) using participantsscreened from November 2019 through February 2021. A total of 331 registryparticipants within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia met theeligibility criteria, which included having CLBP and HRQOL deficits. Almostthree-fourths of the participants were enrolled after onset of the COVID-19pandemic. The participants were randomized to an eHealth intervention for HRQOLor wait list control. The primary outcome measures involved HRQOL based on thePatient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), including the SPADE cluster (Sleep disturbance, Pain interference with activities, Anxiety,Depression, and low Energy/fatigue) and each of its five component scales.Secondary outcome measures involved low back pain intensity and back-relatedfunctioning. Changes over time for each outcome measure reported by participants in each treatment group were compared utilizing the student's t-test forstatistical significance and Cohen's d statistic for clinical importance.Outcomes were reported as between-group differences in change scores and the dstatistic, with positive values favoring the experimental treatment group.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the experimental andcontrol treatment groups for changes over time in any primary outcome measure.The d statistic (95% confidence interval) for the difference between theexperimental and control treatment groups on the SPADE cluster was 0.04(-0.18-0.25). The corresponding d statistics for the SPADE scales ranged from-0.06 (-0.27 to 0.16) for anxiety to 0.11 (-0.10 to 0.33) for sleep disturbance. There were also no significant or clinically important differences between theexperimental and control treatment groups on the secondary outcome measures.Additionally, in subgroup analyses involving participants treated by osteopathic vs allopathic physicians, no significant interaction effects were observed.CONCLUSIONS: The eHealth intervention studied herein did not achievestatistically significant or clinically important improvements in any of theprimary or secondary outcome measures. However, the validity and generalizabilityof the findings may have been limited by the unforeseen onset and impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic shortly after beginning the trial.

TI  - Implications of telehealth services for healthcare delivery and access in ruraland remote communities: perceptions of patients and general practitioners.
LID - 10.1071/PY21162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,Australia has shifted towards greater use of telehealth to deliver care for ruraland remote communities. This policy direction might risk a shift away from thetraditional model of informed person-centred care built around care relationshipsto a technology-mediated health transaction. Potential opportunity costs ofwidespread telehealth services on the quality of care for rural and remotecommunities remain understudied. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted inthree local health districts of rural New South Wales, Australia. Data werecollected through in-depth interviews. A total of 13 participants wasinterviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Patientparticipants perceived telehealth as an alternative when specialist care waslimited or absent. Both patients and clinicians perceived that the deeper caring relationship, enabled through face-to-face interactions, could not be achievedthrough telehealth services alone, and that telehealth services are oftensuperficial and fragmented in nature. Patients in this study contended thatvirtual consultations can be distant and lacking in personal touch, and risklosing sight of social circumstances related to patients' health, therebyaffecting the trust placed in healthcare systems. CONCLUSIONS: Simply replacingface-to-face interactions with telehealth services has the potential to reducetrust, continuity of care, and effectiveness of rural health services. Telehealthmust be used to assist local clinicians in providing the best possible care torural and remote patients within an integrated service delivery model acrossdiverse rural contexts in Australia.

LID - ciac635 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac635 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several COVID-19 vaccines initially showed high efficacy,there have been concerns due to waning immunity and the emergence of variantswith immune escape capacity. METHODS: A test-negative design case-control studywas conducted in 16 healthcare facilities in Japan during the Delta-dominantperiod (August-September 2021) and the Omicron-dominant period (January-March2022). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection wascalculated for 2 doses for the Delta-dominant period and 2 or 3 doses for theOmicron-dominant period, compared to unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: Theanalysis included 5795 individuals with 2595 (44.8%) cases. Among vaccinees, 2242(55.8%) received BNT162b2 and 1624 (40.4%) received mRNA-1273 atmanufacturer-recommended intervals. During the Delta-dominant period, VE was 88% (95% CI: 82-93) 14 days-3 months after dose 2 and 87% (95% CI: 38-97) 3-6 months after dose 2. During the Omicron-dominant period, VE was 56% (95% CI: 37-70) 14days-3 months since dose 2, 52% (95% CI: 40-62) 3-6 months after dose 2, 49% (95%CI: 34-61) 6 + months after dose 2, and 74% (95% CI: 62-83) 14 + days after dose 3. Restricting to individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 and additionaladjustment for preventive measures (i.e. mask-wearing/high-risk behaviors)yielded similar estimates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In Japan where most areinfection-naive and strict prevention measures are maintained regardless ofvaccination status, 2-dose mRNA vaccines provided high protection againstsymptomatic infection during the Delta-dominant period and moderate protectionduring the Omicron-dominant period. Among individuals who received an mRNAbooster dose, VE recovered to a high level.

AB  - RATIONALE: Early corticosteroid treatment is used to treat COVID-19-related acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Infection is a well-documented adverseeffect of corticosteroid therapy. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether earlycorticosteroid therapy to treat COVID-19 ARDS was associated withventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: We retrospectively includedadults with COVID-19-ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) for >/= 48 h at any of 15 intensive care units in 2020. We divided the patients into two groups based on whether they did or did not receive corticosteroids within 24 h. The primary outcome was VAP incidence, with death and extubation as competingevents. Secondary outcomes were day 90-mortality, MV duration, other organdysfunctions, and VAP characteristics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 670patients (mean age, 65 years), 369 did and 301 did not receive earlycorticosteroids. The cumulative VAP incidence was higher with earlycorticosteroids (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.29; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.05-1.58; P = 0.016). Antibiotic resistance of VAP bacteria was notdifferent between the two groups (odds ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.58-1.53; P = 0.81).90-day mortality was 30.9% with and 24.3% without early corticosteroids, anonsignificant difference after adjustment on age, SOFA score, and VAP occurrence(aHR 1.15; 95% CI 0.83-1.60; P = 0.411). VAP was associated with higher 90-daymortality (aHR 1.86; 95% CI 1.33-2.61; P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Earlycorticosteroid treatment was associated with VAP in patients with COVID-19-ARDS. Although VAP was associated with higher 90-day mortality, early corticosteroidtreatment was not. Longitudinal randomized controlled trials of earlycorticosteroids in COVID-19-ARDS requiring MV are warranted.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic severely tested the resilience of the US blood supply with wild fluctuations in blood donation and utilisation rates as community donationopportunities ebbed and hospitals post-poned elective surgery. Key stakeholdersin transfusion services, blood centres, supply chains and manufacturers reviewed their experiences during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as well as available literature to describe successes, opportunities for improvement and lessons learned. Theblood community found itself in uncharted territory responding to restriction of its access to donors (approximately 20% decrease) and some supplies;environmental adjustments to address staff and donor concerns about coronavirustransmission; and the development of a new product (COVID-19 convalescent plasma [CCP]). In assuring that the needs of the patients were paramount, the donationprocess was safe, that clinicians had access to CCP, and vendor relationshipsaligned, the blood banking community relearned its primary focus: improvingpatient outcomes.

TI  - Fantastic perspectives and where to find them: involving patients and citizens indigital health research.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s40900-022-00374-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital contact tracing and exposure notification apps have quicklyemerged as a potential solution to achieve timely and effective contact tracingfor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nonetheless, their actual uptake remains limited.Citizens, including patients, are rarely consulted and included in the design andimplementation process. Their contribution supports the acceptability of suchapps, by providing upstream evidence on incentives and potential barriers thatare most relevant to users. The DIGICIT (DIGITal CITizenship) project relied onpatient and citizen partnership in research to better integrate publicperspectives on these apps. In this paper, we present the co-construction processthat led to the survey instrument used in the DIGICIT project and theinterpretation of its results. This approach promotes public participation inresearch on contact tracing and exposure notification apps, as well as relateddigital health applications. OBJECTIVES: This article has three objectives: (1)describe the methodological process to co-construct a questionnaire and interpretthe survey results with patients and citizens, (2) assess their experiencesregarding this methodology, and (3) propose best practices for their involvement in digital health research. METHODS: The DIGICIT project was developed in foursteps: (1) creation of the advisory committee composed of patients and citizens, (2) co-construction of a questionnaire, (3) interpretation of survey results, and(4) assessment of the experience of committee participants. RESULTS: Of the 25applications received for participation in the advisory committee, we selected 12people based on pre-established diversity criteria. Participants initiallygenerated 84 survey questions in the first co-construction meeting, andeventually selected 36 in the final version. Participants made more than 20recommendations when interpreting survey results and suggested carrying out focusgroups with marginalized populations to increase representativity. Theyappreciated their inclusion early in the research process, being listened to and respected, the collective intelligence, and the method used for integrating theirsuggestions. They suggested that the study objectives and roles be betterdefined, that more time in the brainstorming sessions be allowed, and thatdiscussion outside of meetings be encouraged. CONCLUSION: Having patients andcitizens actively participating in this research constitutes the mainmethodological strength. They enriched the study from start to finish, andrecommended the addition of focus groups to seek the perspective of marginalized groups that are typically under-represented from digital health research. Clearcommunication of the project objectives, good organization in meetings, andcontinuous evaluation from participants allow best practices to be achieved forpatients' and citizens' involvement in digital health research. Co-constructionin research generates critical study design ideas through collectiveintelligence. This methodology can be used in various clinical contexts anddifferent healthcare settings.

OAB - COVID Alert is a mobile application (app) that was developed created to helplimit the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Although promising, these apps have notbeen widely used by the population, in part due to limited citizen engagement in their design. The DIGICIT project (DIGITal CITizenship) was carried out inpartnership with citizens, including patients, to gather public perspective inQuebec, Canada about the COVID Alert app. The purpose of this article is todescribe our method of constructing a survey questionnaire with patients andcitizens. We have created an advisory committee of 12 participants. Along withthe research team, they created a 36-question survey. They also suggested doingfocus groups to add data to the survey by reaching marginalized groups that aretraditionally excluded from digital health research. We also wanted to know theexperience of the participants being included in this study. We conductedinterviews and did a small survey with them. They appreciated being included fromthe beginning of the research, being listened to, and being respected. Theyappreciated the creativity of the group and the brainstorming sessions. However, they would have liked the tasks to be clearer from the start. They also wouldhave preferred to have more time in the brainstorming sessions to create thesurvey questions, and to have discussions outside of the meetings. The inclusion of patients and citizens is the main strength of this project. To improve theirintegration in health research, there needs to be good communication of projectobjectives. Also, meetings must be well organized, and participants must be able to evaluate their experience.

TI  - Cluster analysis unveils a severe persistent respiratory impairment phenotype3-months after severe COVID-19.
PG  - 199
LID - 10.1186/s12931-022-02111-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mid-term respiratory sequelae in survivors of severe COVID-19appear highly heterogeneous. In addition, factors associated with respiratorysequelae are not known. In this monocentric prospective study, we performed amultidisciplinary assessment for respiratory and muscular impairment andpsychological distress 3 months after severe COVID-19. We analysed factorsassociated with severe persistent respiratory impairment, amongst demographic,COVID-19 severity, and 3-month assessment. METHODS: Patients with severeSARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring >/= 4L/min were included for a systematic 3-month visit, including respiratory assessment (symptoms, lung function, CT scan),muscular evaluation (body composition, physical function and activity,disability), psychopathological evaluation (anxiety, depression, post-traumaticstress disorder-PTSD) and quality of life. A cluster analysis was performed toidentify subgroups of patients based on objective functional measurements: DLCO, total lung capacity and 6-min walking distance (6MWD). RESULTS: Sixty-twopatients were analysed, 39% had dyspnea on exercise (mMRC >/= 2), 72% had DLCO < 80%, 90% had CT-scan abnormalities; 40% had sarcopenia/pre-sarcopenia and 31% hadsymptoms of PTSD. Cluster analysis identified a group of patients (n = 18, 30.5%)with a severe persistent (SP) respiratory impairment (DLCO 48 +/- 12%, 6MWD 299+/- 141 m). This SP cluster was characterized by older age, severe respiratorysymptoms, but also sarcopenia/pre-sarcopenia, symptoms of PTSD and markedlyimpaired quality of life. It was not associated with initial COVID-19 severity ormanagement. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATION: We identified a phenotype ofpatients with severe persistent respiratory and muscular impairment andpsychological distress 3 months after severe COVID-19. Our results highlight the need for multidisciplinary assessment and management after severe SARS-CoV-2pneumonia. Trial registration The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (May6, 2020): NCT04376840.

TI  - Therapeutic ultrasound versus injection of local anesthetic in the treatment ofwomen with chronic pelvic pain secondary to abdominal myofascial syndrome: arandomized clinical trial.
PG  - 325
LID - 10.1186/s12905-022-01910-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as recurrent or continuous pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis, either non-menstrual or noncyclical, lasting for at least 6 months. There is strong evidence that up to 85% of patients with CPPhave serious dysfunctions of the musculoskeletal system, including abdominalmyofascial pain syndrome (AMPS). AMPS is characterized by intense and deepabdominal pain, originating from hyperirritable trigger points, usually locatedwithin a musculoskeletal band or its lining fascia. In the literature, there are few studies that address AMPS. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the efficacyof therapeutic ultrasound (TUS) and injection of local anesthetic (IA) to improvepain in women with abdominal myofascial syndrome secondary to CPP. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Tertiary University Hospital.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted, patients wereallocated to two types of treatment: group TUS (n = 18), and group IA (n = 20).The instruments used for evaluation and reassessment were the Visual AnalogScale, Numerical Categorical Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire, and SF-36 quality of life assessment questionnaire. They were evaluated before starting treatment, 1 week after the end of treatment, and at 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: TUS and IAwere effective in reducing clinical pain and improving quality of life throughthe variables analyzed among study participants. There was no significantdifference between groups. LIMITATIONS: absence of blinding; exclusion of womenwith comorbidities and other causes of CPP, the absence of a placebo group, thedifference between the number of sessions used for each technique, and theCOVID-19. CONCLUSION: Treatment with TUS and IA were effective in reducingclinical pain and improving quality of life in women with AMPS secondary to CPP. TRAIL REGISTRATION: We declare that this clinical trial has been registered underthe number [(ReBEC) no. RBR-39czsv] on 07/18/2018 in the Brazilian Registry ofClinical Trials.

TI  - The TROLLEY Study: assessing travel, health, and equity impacts of a new lightrail transit investment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 1475
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13834-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted life in extraordinary ways impacting health and daily mobility. Public transit provides a strategy to improveindividual and population health through increased active travel and reducedvehicle dependency, while ensuring equitable access to jobs, healthcare,education, and mitigating climate change. However, health safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic eroded ridership, which could have longstanding negativeconsequences. Research is needed to understand how mobility and health change as the pandemic recedes and how transit investments impact health and equityoutcomes. METHODS: The TROLLEY (TRansit Opportunities for HeaLth, Livability,Exercise and EquitY) study will prospectively investigate a diverse cohort ofuniversity employees after the opening of a new light rail transit (LRT) line andthe easing of campus COVID-19 restrictions. Participants are current staff wholive either < 1 mile, 1-2 miles, or > 2 miles from LRT, with equal distributionacross economic and racial/ethnic strata. The primary aim is to assess change in physical activity, travel mode, and vehicle miles travelled using accelerometerand GPS devices. Equity outcomes include household transportation andhealth-related expenditures. Change in health outcomes, including depressivesymptoms, stress, quality of life, body mass index and behavior change constructsrelated to transit use will be assessed via self-report. Pre-pandemic variableswill be retrospectively collected. Participants will be measured at 3 times over 2 years of follow up. Longitudinal changes in outcomes will be assessed usingmultilevel mixed effects models. Analyses will evaluate whether proximity to LRT,sociodemographic, and environmental factors modify change in outcomes over time. DISCUSSION: The TROLLEY study will utilize rigorous methods to advance ourunderstanding of health, well-being, and equity-oriented outcomes of new LRTinfrastructure through the COVID-19 recovery period, in a sample ofdemographically diverse adult workers whose employment location is accessed bynew transit. Results will inform land use, transportation and health investments,and workplace interventions. Findings have the potential to elevate LRT as apublic health priority and provide insight on how to ensure public transit meets the needs of vulnerable users and is more resilient in the face of future health pandemics. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The TROLLEY study was registered atClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT04940481 ) June 17, 2021, and OSF Registries (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PGEHU ) June 24, 2021, prior to participantenrollment.

PG  - 611
LID - 10.1186/s12884-022-04941-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are at high risk for affliction by coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19). Vaccination is a main strategy to prevent and manage theCOVID-19 pandemic. However, hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccination (HACV) is amajor public health threat and a major barrier to herd immunity. The aim of thestudy was to evaluate pregnant women's HACV based on the Health Belief Model(HBM). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021-2022.Participants were 352 pregnant women selected from several healthcare centers in the north of Iran. Instruments for data collection were a demographicquestionnaire, a COVID-19 Knowledge Questionnaire, a COVID-19 Health BeliefQuestionnaire, and a question about HACV. Logistic regression analysis was usedto assess the effects of the study variables on HACV. RESULTS: The rate of HACVwas 42.61%. In the regression model, the three factors of perceived benefits(aOR: 0.700; 95% CI: 0.594 to 0.825), cues to action (aOR: 0.621; 95% CI: 0.516to 0.574), and history of reproductive problems (aOR: 2.327; 95% CI: 0.1.262 to4.292) had significant effects on HACV (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: HACV is highlyprevalent among pregnant women. The perceived benefits and cues to actioncomponents of HBM have significant effects on pregnant women's HACV, while theperceived threat component has no significant effect on it. HBM is a good modelto explain HACV among pregnant women. Educational interventions are necessary to improve pregnant women's awareness of the risks of COVID-19 for them and theirfetus.

PG  - 637
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-03338-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In France, the increase in COVID-19 vaccine uptake among older adultsslowed down between May and June 2021. Using the data from a national survey, we aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine uptake among French residents aged 65 years and older, particularly at risk of severe form of the infection, and identify factorsassociated with non-vaccination. METHODS: A cross-sectional online surveycollected the immunization status/intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine, reasons for vaccination/non-vaccination and factors potentially associated with vaccineuptake between May 10 and 23, 2021 among a large sample of French residents.Characteristics of participants were compared according to immunization status.Factors potentially associated with non-vaccination were computed into amultivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 1941 survey participants,1612 (83%) reported having received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Among the 329 unvaccinated, 197 (60%) declared having the intention to get vaccinated. Younger age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.05-2.14), thinking previously having COVID-19 (aOR = 4.01; 95% CI, 2.17-7.40), having suffered economic impact due to the pandemic (aOR = 2.63; 95% CI,1.71-4.04), reporting an "unsafe" opinion about COVID-19 vaccine safety (aOR =6.79; 95% CI, 4.50-10.26), reporting an "unsupportive" opinion about vaccination in general (aOR = 4.24; 95% CI, 2.77-6.49) were independent risk factors fornon-vaccination. On the other hand, trust in COVID-19 vaccine informationdelivered by the doctor (aOR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.48) and trust in thegovernment's actions (aOR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34-0.74) were independent protective factors for non-vaccination. Political affiliation also remained significantlyassociated with vaccine uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high overall COVID-19vaccine uptake among the study participants, differences in vaccine uptakeaccording to the level of concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine safety,socioeconomic profile and trust in the government were observed. Our resultsreinforce the importance of "reaching out" vaccination strategy that specificallytargets the most vulnerable fringe of older adult population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence supports loneliness and social isolation as a strong riskfactor for poor mental and physical health outcomes for older adults. TheCOVID-19 pandemic necessitated older adults isolate themselves for a prolongedduration. The Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto established theStudent-Senior Isolation Prevention Partnership (SSIPP), a volunteer programinvolving telephone calls between medical students and older adults. METHODS: Amixed methods pre-post study design included collecting quantitative data fromolder adults using the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Warwick-Edinburgh MentalWell-being Scale. The study included 29 medical students and 47 older adults. Themedical students filled out a questionnaire on self-perceived knowledge of socialisolation, perception of seniors, attitudes towards seniors, and likelihood toengage in specialties focusing on older adults. Interviews were conducted withboth the older adults and the medical students to understand each groups'experiences and perspectives with taking part in the SSIPP program. RESULTS:Participation in the program resulted in significant changes for medical studentsin areas such as increasing their likelihood to engage in care for older adults(p < .001), improving their knowledge of social isolation for seniors (p < .001),and the value of addressing social isolation in older adults (p < .001). Theinterviews conducted with the medical students support these findings and provideinsight into contributing factors. Loneliness and mental well-being scales didnot show significant changes for older adults however, our interviews revealedthey considered the program to be valuable. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that after the communication outreach program, medical students' perceptions werepositively influenced towards older adults and they were more likely to pursue a career concentrated on older adults. The qualitative analysis revealed olderadults valued the program. Timing and consistency of calls were factorsidentified by this group as having practical importance.

TI  - Role of prognostic scores in predicting in-hospital mortality and failure ofnon-invasive ventilation in adults with COVID-19.
LID - 10.1007/s11739-022-03058-x [doi]
AB  - We tested the prognostic performance of different scores for the identificationof subjects with acute respiratory failure by COVID-19, at risk of in-hospitalmortality and NIV failure. We conducted a retrospective study, in the MedicalHigh-Dependency Unit of the University-Hospital Careggi. We included all subjectswith COVID-19 and ARF requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) between March 2020and January 2021. Clinical parameters, the HACOR score (Heart rate, Acidosis,Consciousness, Oxygenation, Respiratory Rate) and ROX index((SpO2/FiO2)/respiratory rate) were collected 3 (-3) and 1 day (-1) before theNIV initiation, the first day of treatment (Day0) and after 1 (+1), 2 (+2), 5(+5), 8 (+8) and 11 (+11) of treatment. The primary outcomes were in-hospitalmortality and NIV failure. We included 135 subjects, mean age 69+/-13 years, 69% male. Patients, who needed mechanical ventilation, showed a higher HACOR score(Day0: 6 [5-7] vs 6 [6-7], p=.057; Day+2: 6 [6-6] vs 6 [4-6], p=.013) and a lowerROX index (Day0: 4.2+/-2.3 vs 5.1+/-2.3, p=.055; Day+2: 4.4+/-1.2.vs 5.5+/-1.3,p=.001) than those with successful NIV. An HACOR score >5 was more frequent amongnonsurvivors (Day0: 82% vs 58%; Day2: 82% vs 48%, all p<0.01) and it wasassociated with in-hospital mortality (Day0: RR 5.88, 95%CI 2.01-17.22; Day2: RR 4.33, 95%CI 1.64-11.41) independent to age and Charlson index. In conclusion, in subjects treated with NIV for ARF caused by COVID19, respiratory parameterscollected after the beginning of NIV allowed to identify those at risk of anadverse outcome. An HACOR score >5 was independently associated with increasedmortality rate.

TI  - Development and Implementation of a Virtual Clinical Skills Examination inGeneral Psychiatry.
LID - 10.1007/s40596-022-01691-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychiatry programs have administeredthe Clinical Skills Evaluation (CSE) through videoconferencing. The authorsevaluated the feasibility and appropriateness of administering virtual CSEs.METHODS: Virtual CSEs were administered to 11 general psychiatry residents onMarch 16, 2021. Teleconference software was used to connect faculty at worksites, residents at a simulation center, and volunteer patients at home. Beforeand after the CSE, residents and faculty were surveyed with Likert scalequestions to evaluate their perceptions and experience. RESULTS: All virtual CSEswere completed successfully. Nine residents (82%) and 12 faculty (92%) responded to both surveys. Most participants (range, 67-83%) indicated that the virtual CSEwas appropriate for assessing patient health and resident skills. Mostparticipants (range, 56-100%) reported that the opening and closing of theinterview, informational and affective cues, and rapport were adequatelyassessed. All participants agreed that suicidal and homicidal risks could beadequately assessed. Most faculty and residents (76%) believed that unique skillswere required for telehealth interviews. Before the CSE, more faculty thanresidents believed that they received adequate training for the virtual CSE(P=.02); afterward, most participants thought that training was adequate (P=.46).More faculty than residents reported increased convenience with virtualassessments (both surveys, P<.01). CONCLUSION: Virtual CSEs were deemed feasible and appropriate. Further research is needed to identify the specific skillsrequired to perform a virtual CSE and to clarify the potential limitations andbenefits of this format.

TI  - Hypogammaglobulinemia is associated with reduced antibody response afteranti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in MS patients treated with antiCD20 therapies.
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06287-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccination is highly recommended to multiple sclerosis (MS)patients. Little is known about the role of patients' clinical and demographiccharacteristics in determining antibody response. METHODS: We evaluated safetyand efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on 143 included MS patients. Then, weanalyzed antibody titer in a subgroup, assessing clinical and demographicvariables associated with protection and antibody titer. RESULTS: Aftercompleting the vaccination cycle, the rate of local adverse events was similarafter the first and second dose. A higher proportion of systemic AEs was reportedafter the second dose (65.7% vs 24.5% after the first dose). Antibody responsewas evaluated in 97 patients. Higher EDSS (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9, p = 0.006) andtreatment with antiCD20 (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.003-0.098, p 0.001) were associatedwith a lower chance of having an efficacious response. Higher weight wasassociated with higher Ab titer (beta = 15.2, 95% CI 2.8-27.6, p = 0.017), while treatment with antiCD20 with lower titers (beta = - 1092.3, 95% CI - 1477.4 to - 702.2, p < 0.001). In patients treated with antiCD20, hypogammaglobulinemia (beta- 543, 95% CI - 1047.6 to - 39.1, p = 0.036) and treatment duration (beta - 182, 95% CI - 341.4 to - 24.3, p = 0.027) were associated with lower Ab titer.CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that COVID-19 vaccination in MS patient is safeand effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and should be recommended to allpatients. Moreover, we suggest a possible role of hypogammaglobulinemia inreducing Ab response in patients treated with antiCD20 therapies.

AB  - This study provides a novel approach to understand human perception changes intheir experiences of and interactions with public greenspaces during the earlymonths of COVID-19. Using social media data and machine learning techniques, the study delivers new understandings of how people began to feel differently abouttheir experiences compared to pre-COVID times. The study illuminates a renewedappreciation of nature as well as an emerging but prominent pattern of emotional and spiritual experiences expressed through a social media platform. Given thatmost park and recreational studies have almost exclusively examined whether park use increased or decreased during the pandemic, this research provides meaningfulimplications beyond the simple extensional visit pattern and lends weight to the growing evidences on changing perceptions over and the positive psychologicalimpacts of nature. The study highlights the preeminent roles parks andgreenspaces play during the pandemic and guides a new direction in future parkdevelopment to support more natural elements and nature-oriented experiences fromwhich emotional and spiritual well-being outcomes can be drawn.

TI  - Managing ANCA-associated vasculitis during COVID-19 pandemic: a single-centercross-sectional study.
LID - 10.1007/s00296-022-05177-2 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the study is to report the outcomes of COVID-19 inANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients. This was a registry-basedobservational study conducted at a tertiary care center in north India. AAVpatients with at least one follow-up visit between March 2020 and September 2021 were included. Demographic features, clinical manifestations, disease activity,and treatment details of underlying AAV were noted in all patients. Details ofCOVID-19 infection including severity, treatment, and outcomes were noted.Predictors of COVID-19 severity were determined using univariate analysis. Atotal of 33 (18.3%) out of 180 AAV patients contracted COVID-19 infection.Moderate COVID-19 infection was seen in 33.3% and severe or critical infectionwas seen in 36.3% of patients. Seventeen patients (51.5%) required supplementaloxygen therapy. Nine patients had active disease at the time of COVID-19infection and three of them died due to COVID-19 infection. The risk of COVID-19 infection and its severity did not differ between patients receiving differentimmunosuppressants including rituximab induction. Hypothyroidism (p = 0.046) and ocular (p = 0.038) involvement due to AAV predicted the development of moderateto severe/critical COVID-19. Three (9.1%) patients died from COVID-19 and therate of AAV flare after COVID-19 was similar to that in non-COVID-19 patients(15.3/100 person-year vs. 15.6/100 person-year, p = 0.95). Majority of thepatients with AAV had moderate to severe or critical COVID-19 infection. The rateof death due to COVID-19 in AAV is higher than in general population. Use ofstandard remission induction regimens did not lead to increased risk of COVID-19 infection in our AAV cohort.

AB  - Computational models for predicting the early course of the COVID-19 pandemicplayed a central role in policy-making at regional and national levels. Weperformed a systematic review, data synthesis, and secondary validation ofstudies that reported on prediction models addressing the early stages of theCOVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. A literature search in January 2021 based on thesearch triangle model identified 1672 peer-reviewed articles, preprints andreports. After applying inclusion criteria 52 studies remained out of which 12passed a Risk of Bias Opinion Tool. When comparing model predictions with actual outcomes only 4 studies exhibited an acceptable forecast (mean absolutepercentage error, MAPE < 20%). Models that predicted disease incidence could not be assessed due to the lack of reliable data during 2020. Drawing conclusionsabout the accuracy of the models with acceptable methodological quality waschallenging because some models were published before the time period for theprediction, while other models were published during the prediction period oreven afterwards. We conclude that the forecasting models involving Swedendeveloped during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had limitedaccuracy. The knowledge attained in this study can be used to improve thepreparedness for coming pandemics.

LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01172-2 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated invasive fungal infections are an important complication in a substantial number of critically ill, hospitalizedpatients with COVID-19. Three groups of fungal pathogens cause co-infections inCOVID-19: Aspergillus, Mucorales and Candida species, including Candida auris.Here we review the incidence of COVID-19-associated invasive fungal infectionscaused by these fungi in low-, middle- and high-income countries. By evaluatingthe epidemiology, clinical risk factors, predisposing features of the hostenvironment and immunological mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of these co-infections, we set the scene for future research and development of clinicalguidance.

LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01181-1 [doi]
AB  - Pangolins are the most trafficked wild animal in the world according to the WorldWildlife Fund. The discovery of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayanpangolins has piqued interest in the viromes of these wild, scaly-skinnedmammals. We sequenced the viromes of 161 pangolins that were smuggled into China and assembled 28 vertebrate-associated viruses, 21 of which have not beenpreviously reported in vertebrates. We named 16 members of Hunnivirus, Pestivirusand Copiparvovirus pangolin-associated viruses. We report that the L-protein has been lost from all hunniviruses identified in pangolins. Sequences of fourhuman-associated viruses were detected in pangolin viromes, including respiratorysyncytial virus, Orthopneumovirus, Rotavirus A and Mammalian orthoreovirus. Thegenomic sequences of five mammal-associated and three tick-associated viruseswere also present. Notably, a coronavirus related to HKU4-CoV, which wasoriginally found in bats, was identified. The presence of these viruses insmuggled pangolins identifies these mammals as a potential source of emergentpathogenic viruses.

AB  - Immersive ultraviolet disinfection provides a chemical-free technology for safer textiles, surfaces, and public spaces by inactivating communicable pathogens.This study examined immersive UV disinfection, using a disinfection cabinet, ofE. coli and MS2 that was inoculated on white cotton T-shirts. The impact thatporous materials have on UV disinfection is poorly understood with the majorityof previous surface disinfection research focusing on hard, smooth surfaces.Several approaches were used in this study to characterize the light dynamicswithin the disinfection cabinet including colorimetric dosimetry coupons,biodosimetry, and spectroradiometry. Micro and macro geometry of porous surfaces are important factors to consider when using immersive UV technologies. Thegeometry of the cabinet impacted the distribution of emitted UV light within the disinfection cabinet and the physical properties of a porous material, such asthe woven pattern of cotton, both contribute to UV disinfection efficiency. This work identified that light distribution is crucial for immersive UV technologies as the delivered fluence was highly variable within the disinfection cabinet and resulted in a difference of several logs of reduction for adjacent areas ofT-shirt samples. Other inoculated areas achieved upwards of 1-log reductionsvalues for MS2 and upwards of 2-log reductions for E. coli.

TI  - Understanding hesitancy with revealed preferences across COVID-19 vaccine types.
PG  - 13293

AB  - Many countries have secured larger quantities of COVID-19 vaccines than theirpopulation is willing to take. The abundance and the large variety of vaccinescreated not only an unprecedented intensity of vaccine related public discourse, but also a historical moment to understand vaccine hesitancy better. Yet, theheterogeneity of hesitancy by vaccine types has been neglected in the existingliterature so far. We address this problem by analysing the acceptance and theassessment of five vaccine types. We use information collected with a nationally representative survey at the end of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic inHungary. During the vaccination campaign, individuals could reject the assignedvaccine to wait for a more preferred alternative that enables us to quantifyrevealed preferences across vaccine types. We find that hesitancy is heterogenousby vaccine types and is driven by individuals' trusted source of information.Believers of conspiracy theories are more likely to evaluate the mRNA vaccines(Pfizer and Moderna) unacceptable. Those who follow the advice of politicians aremore likely to evaluate vector-based (AstraZeneca and Sputnik) or whole-virusvaccines (Sinopharm) acceptable. We argue that the greater selection of availablevaccine types and the free choice of the individual are desirable conditions toincrease the vaccination rate in societies.

AB  - REGEN-COV, a combination of the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, has been approved as a treatment for high-risk patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 within five days of their diagnosis. We performed a retrospective cohort study,and used data repositories of Israel's largest healthcare organization todetermine the real-world effectiveness of REGEN-COV treatment againstCOVID-19-related hospitalization, severe disease, and death. We compared patientsinfected with Delta variant and treated with REGEN-COV (n = 289) to thoseinfected but not-treated with REGEN-COV (n = 1,296). Demographic and clinicalcharacteristics were used to match patients and for further adjustment as part ofthe C0x model. Estimated treatment effectiveness was defined as one minus thehazard ratio. Treatment effectiveness of REGEN-COV was 56.4% (95% CI: 23.7-75.1%)in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization, 59.2% (95% CI: 19.9-79.2%) in preventing severe COVID-19, and 93.5% (95% CI: 52.1-99.1%) in preventing COVID-19 death inthe 28 days after treatment. In conclusion, REGEN-COV was effective in reducingthe risk of severe sequelae in high-risk COVID-19 patients.

LID - 10.1016/j.bjps.2022.06.037 [doi]
AB  - The brisk remodeling in healthcare delivery observed after the COVID-19 outbreak led us to evaluate how the pandemic affected non-melanoma skin cancer's (NMSC)care and tumor burden. To address this topic, we set up a retrospective real-lifemulti-center study based on the cities of Bergamo and Varese, whose provinceswere the worst hit in Italy by the pandemic. We analyzed medical and pathologicaldata from patients that underwent surgery in the two months preceding theoutbreak in Italy and compared them to those who did in the correspondingbimester of the following year, reaching 214 patients and 274 lesions. Weobserved a considerable and significant increase in NMSC's diameter, as well asin the proportion of squamous cell carcinomas. Both the average waiting time toobtain an evaluation visit and the average time in the surgical waiting list was shorter after the COVID-19 outbreak: the reason is that we evaluated and operatednear-exclusive patients affected by high-priority lesions, who benefited from"fast-track" referrals. Conversely, less-concerning lesions were, and still are, left on hold, until they will become advanced enough to be labeled as "urgent".Plastic surgery departments should evade as soon as possible from this downwardspiral, in order to provide our patients with timely cancer care and to be ableto treat all plastic surgery-requiring pathologies.

TI  - Bayesian adaptive clinical trial designs for respiratory medicine.
LID - 10.1111/resp.14337 [doi]
AB  - The use of Bayesian adaptive designs for clinical trials has increased in recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bayesian adaptive designs offera flexible and efficient framework for conducting clinical trials and may provideresults that are more useful and natural to interpret for clinicians, compared totraditional approaches. In this review, we provide an introduction to Bayesianadaptive designs and discuss its use in recent clinical trials conducted inrespiratory medicine. We illustrate this approach by constructing a Bayesianadaptive design for a multi-arm trial that compares two non-invasive ventilation treatments to standard oxygen therapy for patients with acute cardiogenicpulmonary oedema. We highlight the benefits and some of the challenges involvedin designing and implementing Bayesian adaptive trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The healthcare sector is responsible for 10% of US greenhouse gasemissions. Telehealth use may decrease healthcare's carbon footprint. Ourinstitution introduced telehealth to support SARS-CoV-2 social distancing. Weaimed to evaluate the environmental impact of telehealth rollout. METHODS: Weconducted a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients seen by a surgicalor pre anesthesia provider between March 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021. We measuredpatient-miles saved and CO2 emissions prevented to quantify the environmentalimpact of telehealth. Miles saved were calculated by geodesic distance betweenpatient home address and our institution. Emissions prevented were calculatedassuming 25 miles per gallon fuel efficiency and 19.4 pounds of CO2 produced per gallon of gasoline consumed. Unadjusted Poisson regression was used to assessrelationships between patient demographics, geography, and telehealth use.RESULTS: 60,773 in-person and 10,626 telehealth encounters were included. Thisrepresented an 8,755% increase in telehealth use compared to the year prior.Telehealth resulted in 887,006 patient-miles saved and 688,317 fewer pounds ofCO2 emitted. Demographics significantly associated with decreased telehealth use included Asian and Black/African American racial identity, Hispanic ethnicidentity, and primary language other than English. Further distance from thehospital and higher area deprivation index were associated with increasedtelehealth use (IRR 1.0006 and 1.0077, respectively). CONCLUSION: Incorporatingtelehealth into pediatric surgical and pre anesthesia clinics resulted insignificant CO2 emission reductions. Expanded telehealth use could mitigatesurgical and anesthesia service contributions to climate change. Racial andlinguistic minority status were associated with significantly lower rates oftelehealth utilization, necessitating additional inquiry into equitabletelemedicine use for minoritized populations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of different artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the identification of pulmonaryinvolvement by SARS-CoV-2 based on portable chest radiography (RX). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study that included patients admitted forsuspected COVID-19 infection in a university hospital between July and November2020. The reference standard of pulmonary involvement by SARS-CoV-2 comprised apositive PCR test and low-tract respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: 493 patients were included, 140 (28%) with positive PCR and 32 (7%) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The AI-B algorithm had the best diagnostic performance (areas under the ROC curveAI-B 0.73, vs. AI-A 0.51, vs. AI-C 0.57). Using a detection threshold greaterthan 55%, AI-B had greater diagnostic performance than the specialist [(areaunder the curve of 0.68 (95% CI 0.64-0.72), vs. 0.54 (95% CI 0.49-0.59)].CONCLUSION: AI algorithms based on portable RX enabled a diagnostic performancecomparable to human assessment for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 lung involvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dental fear is common and yet often remains unrecognised. COVID-19has challenged health care since 2020. This study aimed to evaluate patients'self-reported dental fear and detection of dental fear by the dentists. Anotheraim was to validate a colour code instrument for estimating dental fear. Theinfluence of COVID-19 on fear and attendance was assessed. METHODS: Across-sectional survey was conducted in the primary urgent dental care of Oulu,Finland, in spring 2020 and 2021 after the first (T1) and third waves (T2) of thepandemic. Data were obtained for analyses using the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale(MDAS), Facial Image Scale (FIS), and a new "traffic light" colour code fordental fear (CCF). The influence of COVID-19 on dental fear and attendance wasassessed with structured and open-ended questions. The questionnaires werecompleted by 273 anonymous participants. RESULTS: Of the participants, 167(61.2%) visited dental care during T1 and 106 (38.8%) during T2. Their mean agewas 45.1 years. An MDAS score of 19 or above, indicating severe fear, wasreported by 10.6% of the participants. Of those with severe dental fear, 87%chose the red colour in the CCF "traffic light" system. The association betweendentists' and participants' estimation of dental fear was weak (P < .001) andagreement with the red code was nonexistent (Cohen's kappa value = -0.035). MDAS scores of the younger participants were higher than those of the older ones afterthe first wave (T1) (P = .021). COVID-19 had the strongest influence on dentalattendance and dental fear of those having the most severe self-reported dentalfear as measured by the MDAS. CONCLUSIONS: Colour-coded traffic lights seem validfor screening severe dental fear and are easy and quick to use. They could beuseful tools especially since recognising dental fear seems difficult fordentists. The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated dental care for the most fearful individuals.

LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.07.034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccinations applied in pharmacies can facilitateaccessibility and potentially increase the vaccination rate but remaincontroversial in many countries. This study aimed to explore the patients'motivation to receive their COVID-19 vaccination in a pharmacy and examinepatient and provider satisfaction with this novel service. METHODS: The study wasdesigned as an explorative cross-sectional multicenter in-house quantitativesurvey and was conducted during the first weeks of COVID-19 vaccinations inGerman pharmacies from February to April 2022. The survey consisted of apaper-based questionnaire with scaling questions, multiple choice questions andopen questions. Patients were recruited consecutively before their vaccinationand completed the survey directly after the service. Vaccinating pharmacists werealso invited to answer a questionnaire on their experiences, motivation andexpectations. RESULTS: A total of 427 questionnaires out of 11 pharmacies were beincluded. The overall patient satisfaction with vaccinations in pharmacies wasrated with the highest remarks by 91.5% of the participants, another 7.8% werefairly satisfied. Patient satisfaction with scheduling, waiting time,information, hygiene, vaccination technique and a feeling of safety was very high(96.5-97.9%). Patients' motivation on COVID-19 vaccination was to prevent severe COVID-19 symptoms (88.9%) and to protect others (72.3%). Easy accessibility, low barriers and proximity were other reasons for utilizing this service, mentionedby 61.8% of the patients. Pharmacists were highly motivated and found the taskmeaningful but experienced considerable personnel shortage. General practitionersrather expressed relief on their workload. CONCLUSIONS: Data of this studystrongly supports to include pharmacies as additional providers of COVID-19vaccinations. Patients stated marked satisfaction with this setting and expresseda feeling of safety and trust. Whereas most patients may have utilized theservice for convenience, easy accessibility and low barriers were appreciated andcan potentially contribute to higher vaccination rates.

BTI - Perioperative exercise programmes to promote physical activity in the medium tolong term: systematic review and qualitative research
LID - 10.3310/NZPN0787 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In England, more than 4 million hospital admissions lead to surgeryeach year. The perioperative encounter (from initial presentation in primary careto postoperative return to function) offers potential for substantial healthgains in the wider sense and over the longer term. OBJECTIVES: The aim was toidentify, examine and set in context a range of interventions appliedperioperatively to facilitate physical activity in the medium to long term. DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched - Cochrane Central Register ofControlled Trials, MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied HealthLiterature, EMBASE, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus in October 2020. Clinical trialsdatabases were also searched, and backward and forward citation searches wereconducted. REVIEW METHODS: We undertook a systematic review; ran databasesearches in October 2020; extracted data; conducted risk-of-bias assessments ofstudies; and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development andEvaluation assessments. We conducted focus groups and interviews with peoplerunning services designed to promote physical activity, to understand thepractical and contextual factors that make such interventions 'work'. Althoughthe two streams of work were conducted independently, we considered overlappingthemes from their findings. RESULTS: In the review, we found 51 randomisedcontrolled trials and two quasi-randomised trials; nine non-randomised studiesformed a supplementary data set. Studies included 8604 adults who had undergone(or were undergoing) surgery, and compared 67 interventions facilitating physicalactivity. Most interventions were started postoperatively and included multiplecomponents, grouped as follows: education and advice, behavioural mechanisms and physical activity instruction. Outcomes were often measured using differenttools; pooling of data was not always feasible. Compared with usual care,interventions may have slightly increased the amount of physical activity,engagement in physical activity and health-related quality of life at the study'send (moderate-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence of an increasein physical fitness and a reduction in pain, although effects generally favoured interventions. Few studies reported adherence and adverse events; certainty ofthese findings was very low. Although infrequently reported, participantsgenerally provided positive feedback. For the case studies, we conducted twoonline focus groups and two individual interviews between November 2020 andJanuary 2021, with nine participants from eight services of physical activityprogrammes. Conceptual and practical aspects included how the promotion ofphysical activity can be framed around the individual to recruit and retainpatients; how services benefit from committed and compassionate staff; howenthusiasts, data collection and evidence play key roles; and how digitaldelivery could work as part of a blended approach, but inequalities in accessmust be considered. LIMITATIONS: Outcome measures in the review varied and,despite a large data set, not all studies could be pooled. This also limited the exploration of differences between interventions; components of interventionsoften overlapped between studies, and we could not always determine what 'usualcare' involved. The case study exploration was limited by COVID-19 restrictions; we were unable to visit sites and observe practice, and the range of services in the focus groups was also limited. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from the reviewindicates that interventions delivered in the perioperative setting, aimed atenhancing physical activity in the longer term, may have overall benefit. Thequalitative analysis complemented these findings and indicated that interventionsshould be focused around the individual, delivered locally and compassionately,and promoted by a patient's full clinical team. There is a need to develop a coreoutcome set for similar studies to allow quantitative synthesis. Future workshould also investigate the experiences of patients in different contexts, suchas different communities, and with different surgical indications.

AB  - As of 16 February 2021, over 108 million people worldwide have been diagnosedwith COVID-19, according to the WHO dashboard. The pandemic has so far claimedmore than 2.3 million lives, and many areas of the world are experiencing aresurgence in cases. This living guideline responds to emerging evidence fromrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) on prophylactic interventions for COVID-19.These interventions aim to prevent the disease developing in those who are freefrom disease. Interventions could target whole populations, those at higher risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to their work, social circumstances or aparticular exposure, or target those at higher risk of death and poor outcomes.There are 2610 registered or ongoing trials investigating various interventionsfor COVID-19 (see Section 8). This rapidly evolving evidence landscape requirestrustworthy interpretation and expeditious clinical practice guidelines to informclinicians, patients, governments, ministries and health administrators.

AB  - As of 8 June 2022, over 530 000 000 people worldwide have been diagnosed withCOVID-19, with over 6.3 million deaths according to the WHO dashboard. A newvariant, Omicron, that emerged in late November 2021 is now the dominant strainacross the world and has contributed to the ongoing surge in several countries.Vaccination is having a substantial impact on case numbers and hospitalizationsin a number of high-income countries, but limitations in global access tovaccines mean that many populations remain vulnerable. Even in vaccinatedindividuals, uncertainties remain about duration of protection and efficacy ofcurrent vaccines against Omicron and other emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Takentogether, there remains a need for more effective treatments for COVID-19. TheCOVID-19 pandemic - and the explosion of both research and misinformation - hashighlighted the need for trustworthy, accessible and regularly updated livingguidelines to place emerging findings into context and provide clearrecommendations for clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the first COVID-19 lockdown impact on sleepsymptoms in patients with narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) and restlesslegs syndrome (RLS). METHODS: Between March and May 2020, a sample of adultpatients regularly followed-up in a Reference Hospital Sleep Unit (299 withnarcolepsy, 260 with IH, 254 with RLS) was offered an online survey assessingtheir sleep-wake habits, daily activities, medication intake, and validatedscales: International RLS Study Group questionnaire, Narcolepsy Severity Scale(NSS), IH Severity Scale (IHSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), InsomniaSeverity Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and European Quality of Life (QoL) scale. The survey was proposed once, and the questions were answered for thepre-lockdown (recall of the month before the confinement) and the lockdown (time of study) periods. RESULTS: Overall, 331 patients completed the survey (response rate 40.7%): 102 with narcolepsy, 81 with IH and 148 with RLS. All patientsreported later bedtimes, with reduced differences for time in bed (TIB) and totalsleep time (TST) over-24h between weekdays and weekends. Narcoleptic patientsspent more TIB and increased TST overnight, with more daytime napping. They hadmore awakenings, higher ESS scores, lower QoL, and no NSS changes. IH patientshad also increased TIB, TST overnight and 24-h on weekdays. Nocturnal sleeplatency and number of awakenings increased, but with no change in ESS, QoL, andIHSS scores. RLS patients reported a longer nocturnal sleep latency, moreawakenings, more naps, a decreased TIB and TST overnight. RLS severity increased while QoL decreased. A significant portion of patients reported disease worseningduring lockdown (narcolepsy:39.4%, IH:43.6%, RLS:32.8%), and some patientsstopped or lowered their medication (narcolepsy:22.5%, IH:28%, RLS:9.5%).CONCLUSION: During the lockdown, all patients reported later bedtimes; those withnarcolepsy and IH extended their sleep duration unlike RLS patients. Thesechanges were often associated with negative consequences on QoL. In the currentcontext of recurrent COVID-19 waves, the recent development of teleconsultations should enable physicians to monitor patients with chronic sleep disorders moreclosely, to recommend optimized sleep schedules and duration, in order to preventpsychological problems and improve their QoL.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increased anxious-depressive symptomatology isobserved in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which mayaccelerate disease progression. We investigated whether amyloid-beta, corticalthickness in medial temporal lobe structures , neuroinflammation andsociodemographic factors were associated with greater anxious-depressive symptomsduring the COVID-19 confinement. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included cognitively unimpaired older adults from the ALFA (Alzheimer andFAmilies) cohort, the majority with a family history of sporadic AD. Participantsperformed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during the COVID-19confinement. A subset had available retrospective (on average: 2.4 years before) HADS assessment, amyloid [(18)F] flutemetamol PET and structural MRI scans andCSF markers of neuroinflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6], triggering receptorexpressed on myeloid cells 2 and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels). Weperformed multivariable linear regression models to investigate the associations of pre-pandemic AD-related biomarkers and sociodemographic factors with HADSscores during the confinement. We further performed an analysis of covariance in order to adjust by participants' pre-pandemic anxiety-depression levels .Finally, we explored the role of stress and lifestyle changes (sleep patterns,eating, drinking, smoking habits, and medication use) on the tested associations and performed sex-stratified analyses. RESULTS: We included 921 (254 with ADbiomarkers) participants. Amyloid-beta positivity (B=3.73; 95%CI=1.1 to 6.36;p=.006), caregiving (B=1.37; 95%CI=0.24 to 2.5; p=.018), sex (women: B=1.95;95%CI=1.1 to 2.79; p<.001), younger age (B=-0.12; 95%CI=-0.18 to -0.052; p<.001) and lower education (B=-0.16; 95%CI=-0.28 to -0.042; p=.008) were associated withgreater anxious-depressive symptoms during the confinement. Consideringpre-pandemic anxiety-depression levels, we further observed an associationbetween lower levels of CSF IL-6 (B=-5.11; 95%CI=-10.1 to -0.13; p=.044) andgreater HADS scores. The results were independent of stress-related variables andlifestyle changes. Stratified analysis revealed that the associations were mainlydriven by women. DISCUSSION: Our results link AD-related pathophysiology andneuroinflammation with greater anxious-depressive symptomatology during theCOVID-19-related confinement, notably in women. AD pathophysiology may increaseneuropsychiatric symptomatology in response to stressors. This association mayimply a worse clinical prognosis in people at risk for AD after the pandemic, andthus deserves to be considered by clinicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians have had concernsrelated to the impact of the pandemic on their practice of medicine. Ourobjective was to evaluate physician questions and concerns related to theCOVID-19 pandemic by studying physician calls made to a medico-legal telephonehelpline, and explore associations between the pattern of these calls and thetemporal progression of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive studyof calls related to the COVID-19 pandemic to the Canadian Medical ProtectiveAssociation (CMPA) from Jan. 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Using content analysis,we classified calls into themes. Using a Poisson regression model, we tested for associations between the weekly numbers of physician calls related to COVID-19and national rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. RESULTS: We analyzed 3810COVID-19-related calls. The highest call volume was observed during thepandemic's early months and was widely distributed across the country. Callvolume correlated with rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic's first wave (p = 0.002) but not across the entire study period. Call themes includedvirtual care (826 calls), the pandemic's effect on health care (1160 calls) andchallenging patient interactions (1091 calls). INTERPRETATION: We observed highvolumes of physician calls to a medico-legal helpline during the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Our data provide insight into the questionsand concerns of Canadian physicians, and serve as a contemporaneous account ofthe adaptability and resilience of physicians during this challenging time.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of synchronousonline education on the patient safety competency (knowledge, attitudes, andskills) of nursing students in Korea and to explore what they thought about this educational method. METHODS: A single-group pre-and post-test design andsummative content analysis were implemented. On November 14th, 2020, 110 nursing students completed synchronous online patient safety education. Patient safetycompetency was measured before and after the intervention using the revisedPatient Safety Competency Self-Evaluation tool. The descriptive statistics,paired t-test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to analyze the data.Students also expressed their opinions about this education based on open-endedquestions. RESULTS: All the patient safety competency scores significantlyincreased after intervention. A summative content analysis of the open-endedquestions yielded 5 categories: educational materials, education level, educationtime, interaction, and educational media. CONCLUSION: This study found thatsynchronous online patient safety education improves nursing students' knowledge on, attitudes towards, and skills in patient safety. Nursing students alsoexpressed a variety of positive aspects of the online education method. Toimprove the efficacy of synchronous online patient safety education, there is aneed for further empirical studies on the appropriate class duration anddifficulty of the content. It is essential to find a way to combine onlineeducation with various learning activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the durability of response 3 months after the thirdBNT162b2 vaccine in adults aged 60 years and older. DESIGN: Prospective cohortstudy. SETTING: Single tertiary centre. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers/familymembers aged >/=60 years old who received the third BNT162b2 dose. INTERVENTIONS:Blood samples were drawn immediately before (T0), 10-19 days (T1) and 74-103 days(T2) after the third dose. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Anti-spike IgGtitres were determined using a commercial assay and seropositivity was defined as>/=50 arbitrary units (AU)/mL. Neutralising antibody titres were determined atT2. Adverse events, COVID-19 infections and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) levelswere documented. RESULTS: The analysis included 97 participants (median age, 70years (IQR, 66-74), 58% CFS level 2). IgG titres, which increased significantlyfrom T0 to T1 (median, 440 AU/mL (IQR, 294-923) and median, 25 429 AU/mL (IQR, 14203-36 114), respectively; p<0.001), decreased significantly by T2, but allremained seropositive (median, 8306 AU/mL (IQR, 4595-14 701), p<0.001 vs T1). In a multivariable analysis, only time from the second vaccine was significantlyassociated with lower IgG levels at T2 (p=0.017). At T2, 60 patients wereevaluated for neutralising antibodies; all were seropositive (median, 1294antibody titres; IQR, 848-2072). Neutralising antibody and anti-spike IgG levels were correlated (r=0.6, p<0.001). No major adverse events or COVID-19 infections were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-spike IgG and neutralising antibody levelsremain adequate 3 months after the third BNT162b2 vaccine in healthy adults aged >/=60 years, although the decline in IgG is concerning. A third dose of vaccinein this population should be top priority.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence points to rising levels of psychological distressresulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for self-administered,low-cost, and accessible interventions that facilitate wellbeing and growth.METHODS: This study used a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design toinvestigate the effects of a two-week positivity-oriented photographyintervention on wellbeing and posttraumatic growth in comparison to a controlgroup. Participants were adults between the ages of 21 and 80 living in the UKrecruited between May and August 2020 (n = 109). RESULTS: After adjusting forbaseline wellbeing, both wellbeing and PTG were significantly higher in theintervention group compared to the control group following interventioncompletion, with this effect remaining similar at one-month follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: The study offers preliminary evidence that a brief self-administeredphotography intervention could hold therapeutic value.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of covid-19 death after infection with omicron BA.1compared with delta (B.1.617.2). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING:England, United Kingdom, from 1 December 2021 to 30 December 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 1 035 149 people aged 18-100 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 under thenational surveillance programme and had an infection identified as omicron BA.1or delta compatible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was covid-19death as identified from death certification records. The exposure of interestwas the SARS-CoV-2 variant identified from NHS Test and Trace PCR positive tests taken in the community (pillar 2) and analysed by Lighthouse laboratories. Cause specific Cox proportional hazard regression models (censoring non-covid-19deaths) were adjusted for sex, age, vaccination status, previous infection,calendar time, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation rank, householddeprivation, university degree, keyworker status, country of birth, mainlanguage, region, disability, and comorbidities. Interactions between variant andsex, age, vaccination status, and comorbidities were also investigated. RESULTS: The risk of covid-19 death was 66% lower (95% confidence interval 54% to 75%) foromicron BA.1 compared with delta after adjusting for a wide range of potentialconfounders. The reduction in the risk of covid-19 death for omicron comparedwith delta was more pronounced in people aged 18-59 years (number of deaths:delta=46, omicron=11; hazard ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.27)than in those aged >/=70 years (number of deaths: delta=113, omicron=135; hazard ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.61, P<0.0001). No evidence of adifference in risk was found between variant and number of comorbidities.CONCLUSIONS: The results support earlier studies showing a reduction in severity of infection with omicron BA.1 compared with delta in terms of hospitaladmission. This study extends the research to also show a reduction in the riskof covid-19 death for the omicron variant compared with the delta variant.

TI  - Uncovering SARS-COV-2 vaccine uptake and COVID-19 impacts among First Nations,Inuit and Metis Peoples living in Toronto and London, Ontario.
PG  - E1018-E1026

AB  - BACKGROUND: First Nations, Inuit and Metis Peoples across geographies are athigher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 because of high rates of chronicdisease, inadequate housing and barriers to accessing health services. MostIndigenous Peoples in Canada live in cities, where SARS-CoV-2 infection isconcentrated. To address gaps in SARS-CoV-2 information for these urbanpopulations, we partnered with Indigenous agencies and sought to generate ratesof SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination, and incidence of infection for FirstNations, Inuit and Metis living in 2 Ontario cities. METHODS: We drew on existingcohorts of First Nations, Inuit and Metis adults in Toronto (n = 723) and London (n = 364), Ontario, who were recruited using respondent-driven sampling. Welinked to ICES SARS-CoV-2 databases and prospectively monitored rates ofSARS-CoV-2 testing, diagnosis and vaccination for First Nations, Inuit and Metis,and comparator city and Ontario populations. RESULTS: We found that SARS-CoV-2testing rates among First Nations, Inuit and Metis were higher in Toronto (54.7%,95% confidence interval [CI] 48.1% to 61.3%) and similar in London (44.5%, 95% CI36.0% to 53.1%) compared with local and provincial rates. We determined thatcumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not significantly differentamong First Nations, Inuit and Metis in Toronto (7364/100 000, 95% CI 2882 to 11 847) or London (7707/100 000, 95% CI 2215 to 13 200) compared with city rates. Wefound that rates of vaccination among First Nations, Inuit and Metis in Toronto(58.2%, 95% CI 51.4% to 64.9%) and London (61.5%, 95% CI 52.9% to 70.0%) werelower than the rates for the 2 cities and Ontario. INTERPRETATION: AlthoughOntario government policies prioritized Indigenous populations for SARS-CoV-2vaccination, vaccine uptake was lower than in the general population for FirstNations, Inuit and Metis Peoples in Toronto and London. Ongoing access toculturally safe testing and vaccinations is urgently required to avoiddisproportionate hospital admisson and mortality related to COVID-19 in thesecommunities.

PG  - e10768
LID - 10.1002/wer.10768 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 wastewater-based epidemiology has been performed in catchments ofvarious sizes and sewer types with many short-term studies available andmulti-seasonal studies emerging. The objective of this study was to compareweekly observations of SARS-CoV-2 genes in municipal wastewater across multipleseasons for different systems as a factor of sewer type (combined, separatesanitary) and system size. Sampling occurred following the first wave ofSARS-CoV-2 cases in the study region (June 2020) and continued through the third wave (May 2021), the period during which clinical testing was widely availableand different variants dominated clinical cases. The strongest correlations were observed between wastewater N1 concentrations and the cumulative clinical casesreported in the 2 weeks prior to wastewater sampling, followed by the week prior,new cases, and the week after wastewater sampling. Sewer type and size did notnecessarily explain the strength of the correlations, indicating that othernon-sewer factors may be impacting the observations. In-system sampling resultsfor the largest system sampled are presented for 1 month. Removing wet weatherdays from the data sets improved even the flow-normalized correlations for thesystems, potentially indicating that interpreting results during wet weatherevents may be more complicated than simply accounting for dilution. PRACTITIONER POINTS: SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater correlated best with total clinical casesreported in 2 weeks before wastewater sampling at the utility level. Studyperformed when clinical testing was widespread during the year after the firstCOVID-19 wave in the region. Sewer type and size did not necessarily explaincorrelation strength between clinical cases and wastewater-based epidemiologyresults. Removing wet weather days improved correlations for 3/4 utilitiesstudied, including both separate sanitary and combined sewers.

TI  - Investigation of Antibiotic Resistome in Hospital Wastewater during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Is the Initial Phase of the Pandemic Contributing to AntimicrobialResistance?
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c01834 [doi]
AB  - Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, there has been much speculation about howCOVID-19 and antimicrobial resistance may be interconnected. In this study,untreated wastewater was sampled from Hospital A designated to treat COVID-19patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic alongside Hospital B thatdid not receive any COVID-19 patients. Metagenomics was used to determine therelative abundance and mobile potential of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs),prior to determining the correlation of ARGs with time/incidence of COVID-19. Ourfindings showed that ARGs resistant to macrolides, sulfonamides, andtetracyclines were positively correlated with time in Hospital A but not inHospital B. Likewise, minor extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) andcarbapenemases of classes B and D were positively correlated with time,suggesting the selection of rare and/or carbapenem-resistant genes in Hospital A.Non-carbapenemase blaVEB also positively correlated with both time and intI1 and was copresent with other ARGs including carbapenem-resistant genes in 6metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). This study highlighted concerns related tothe dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) during the COVID-19 pandemic that may arise from antibiotic use and untreated hospital wastewater.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the symptom overlap between allergic rhinitis (AR) andCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), pandemic-time anxiety in people with ARremains an area of limited study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the AR-anxietyrelationship in the unique context of the COVID-19 pandemic from a Canadianperspective. METHODS: The COVID-19 Associated Anxiety in patients with Asthma andAR Experiencing Symptoms (CAAARES) survey was distributed on the "Qualtrics XM"platform, with 835 adult participants responding to the first iteration fromApril-August 2020. Anxiety was assessed on the Generalized Anxiety DisorderAssessment-7 (GAD-7) and AR burden of disease was assessed on theRhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). All analyses wereconducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 27. RESULTS: High levels of anxiety werefound, with 28.0% of the AR group and 27.5% of the control group meetingdiagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. After controlling forcovariates, AR status had no significant predictive effect on GAD-7 in ahierarchal multiple regression (HMR) model (DeltaR2=.00, p=.688). In the ARsubgroup, there were significant positive correlations between anxiety and burdenof disease for the total RQLQ score and all 7 domain scores (p<.001 for all),with the non-nose/eye symptom domain having the strongest correlation (r=.63).After controlling for covariates, total RQLQ score had a predictive effect onGAD-7 in an HMR model (DeltaR2 =.049, p<.001). CONCLUSION: High levels of anxietyexist during the COVID-19 pandemic regardless of AR status, indicating theimportance of early anxiety screening in all patients. This study also highlightsthe importance of non-nose/eye symptoms in AR management.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected not only the physical and emotional health ofhuman beings but also cats. Restrictions put into effect during the pandemicresulted in changes in the daily routine of pet cats and the number of new petowners. The current study aimed to evaluate the diseases induced by stress incats, such as gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and urinary tract diseases. Tothis end, the study evaluated the pre-pandemic (n: 52) (March 2019-Feb 2020) and pandemic (n: 95) (March 2020-March 2021) diagnosis data of cats (n: 147) withgastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and urinary system diseases admitted to theInternal Medicine Department of Hatay Mustafa Kemal University Veterinary Health,Practice and Research Center between March 2019 and March 2021. There was nostatistically significant difference between the sexes of the cats admitted tothe clinic in both periods. There was a significant change in cat breeds duringthe pandemic, except for the mixed-breed and Ankara breeds. The age (mean +/-SEM) of the cats admitted to the clinic was 30.14 +/- 4.24 months before thepandemic and 30.45 +/- 3.43 during the pandemic. Distributions ofgastrointestinal diseases in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods weredetermined as 35.7% and 64.3%, respectively. During the pandemic, the number ofgastritis cases was lower than that in the pre-pandemic period, and the number ofgastroenteritis cases was higher than that in the pre-pandemic period. Except forgastrointestinal diseases (P<0.05), a statistical difference between the periods was not found. The changes, especially influencing the daily routine of cats and causing stress, seem to have had significant effects on the gastrointestinalhealth of domestic cats.

AB  - Elevated resting heart rate variability (HRV) in the high frequency range hasbeen proposed to be protective against worrying when facing environmentalstressors. Yet, prospective studies using real-life stressors are still scarce.The present study set out to replicate the previous finding of reduced restingHRV predicting COVID-19-associated worries in a larger, more homogenous sampleover a longer period of time (N = 123; age: 42.32 [SD:10.72]; 65.9% female;average time lag: six years). In addition, we were interested in investigatingthe specificity of this effect with respect to worry content, other physiologicalmarkers of autonomic functions, and additional potentially relevant covariateswith a special focus on a potential moderating effect of sex on this association.In regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, BMI and smoking status, theinteraction between HRV and sex was significant, with women depicting a stronger association between HRV and COVID-19 associated worries. Further sensitivityanalyses revealed the specificity of the effect for HRV as distinct from meanheart rate, as well as its dependence on previous COVID-19 infection, but notCOVID-19 vaccination status and chronic stress level. These data are in line withtheories that propose that higher HRV levels can be protective against thedeleterious effects of real-life environmental stressors. However, our resultsalso point to the specificity of this effect, especially with respect to worrycontent and sex.

AB  - BACKGROUND: and Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 is currently considered as the mostchallenging issue in the field of health and medicine by causing a globalpandemic. Vaccines are counted as a promising candidate to terminate this deadly pandemic. Various structural proteins in SARS-CoV-2 have recently drawn attentionto be utilized as candidate vaccines to stimulate immune responses againstCOVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In current study, the RBD protein was cloned andexpressed in E. coli host. Then, the expressed RBD protein was purified and itscharacterizations were evaluated through various methods. Gold nanoparticles,which were utilized as a carrier for candidate Nano-vaccine, were synthesized viaoxidation-reduction reaction. While Gold NPs-conjugated RBD was injected into thesecond treatment group, in the first candidate vaccine, RBD was injected into thefirst treatment group solely. Complete and Incomplete Freud's Adjuvant were also utilized for both treatment groups to enhance the immune responses against RBDantigen. Immunizations were repeated 2 times in 14-day intervals to boost theimmune system of BALB/c mice. The humoral and cell-mediated immune responses wereexamined through immune and cytokine assays. RESULTS: Our outcomes demonstratethat strong short-term humoral immunity (IgM) was induced in both the first andsecond treatment group, while long-term humoral responses (IgG) were onlyobserved in the second treatment group. While stronger short- and long-termhumoral (IgM and IgG, respectively) were observed in the second treatment group, particular cytokines production (TNF-a and IFN-gamma) as a marker ofcell-mediated responses were significantly higher in the first treatment group.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study results show the high potentiality of RBDprotein as an appropriate stimulating antigen in vaccine synthesis and testifies RBD-based candidate vaccines to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Our outcomes also recommend that Nano-vaccines can be more suitable candidates when strongerlong-term immune responses matter.

AB  - The frequently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have weakened the effectiveness ofexisting COVID-19 vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapy. Nevertheless, theinfections of SARS-CoV-2 variants still depend on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) receptor-mediated cell entry, and thus the soluble human ACE2 (shACE2) is a potential decoy for broadly blocking SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, wefirstly generated the recombinant AAVrh10-vectored shACE2 constructs, a kind ofadeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype with pulmonary tissue tropism, and thenvalidated its inhibition capacity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. To furtheroptimize the minimized ACE2 functional domain candidates, a comprehensiveanalysis was performed to clarify the interactions between the ACE2 orthologsfrom various species and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike(S) protein. Based on the key interface amino acids, we designed a series oftruncated ACE2 orthologs, and then assessed their potential affinity to bind toSARS-CoV-2 variants RBD in silico. Of note, we found that the 24-83aa fragment ofdog ACE2 (dACE224-83) had a higher affinity to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 variantsthan that of human ACE2. Importantly, AAVrh10-vectored shACE2 or dACE224-83constructs exhibited a broadly blockage breadth against SARS-CoV-2 prototype and and variants in vitro and ex vivo. Collectively, these data highlighted apromising therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

AB  - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, new variants have continuously emerged andspread in populations. Among these, variants of concern (VOC) have been the main culprits of successive epidemic waves, due to their transmissibility,pathogenicity or ability to escape the immune response. Quantification of theSARS-CoV-2 genomes in raw wastewater is a reliable approach well-described andwidely deployed worldwide to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humanpopulations connected to sewage systems. Discrimination of VOCs in wastewater is also a major issue and can be achieved by genome sequencing or by detection ofspecific mutations suggesting the presence of VOCs. This study aimed to date the emergence of these VOCs (from Alpha to Omicron BA.2) by monitoring wastewaterfrom the greater Paris area, France, but also to model the propagation dynamicsof these VOCs and to characterize the replacement kinetics of the prevalentpopulations. These dynamics were compared to various individual-centered publichealth data, such as regional incidence and the proportions of VOCs identified bysequencing of strains isolated from patient. The viral dynamics in wastewaterhighlighted the impact of the vaccination strategy on the viral circulationwithin human populations but also suggested its potential effect on the selectionof variants most likely to be propagated in immunized populations. Normalization of concentrations to capture population movements appeared statistically morereliable using variations in local drinking water consumption rather than usingPMMoV concentrations because PMMoV fecal shedding was subject to variability and was not sufficiently relevant in this study. The dynamics of viral spread wasobserved earlier (about 13days on the wave related to Omicron VOC) in rawwastewater than the regional incidence alerting to a possible risk ofdecorrelation between incidence and actual virus circulation probably resultingfrom a lower severity of infection in vaccinated populations.

AB  - Asthma, COPD, COVID-19, EGPA, Lung cancer, and Pneumonia are major chronicrespiratory diseases (or CRDs) affecting millions worldwide and account forsubstantial morbidity and mortality. These CRDs are irreversible diseases thataffect different parts of the respiratory system, imposing a considerable burden on different socio-economic classes. All these CRDs have been linked to increasedeosinophils in the lungs. Eosinophils are essential immune mediators thatcontribute to tissue homeostasis and the pathophysiology of various diseases.Interestingly, elevated eosinophil level is associated with cellular processesthat regulate airway hyperresponsiveness, airway remodeling, mucushypersecretion, and inflammation in the lung. Therefore, eosinophil is consideredthe therapeutic target in eosinophil-mediated lung diseases. Although,conventional medicines like antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, andbronchodilators are available to prevent CRDs. But the development of resistance to these therapeutic agents after long-term usage remains a challenge. However,progressive development in nanotechnology has unveiled the targeted nanocarrierapproach that can significantly improve the pharmacokinetics of a therapeuticdrug. The potential of the nanocarrier system can be specifically targeted oneosinophils and their associated components to obtain promising results in thepharmacotherapy of CRDs. This review intends to provide knowledge abouteosinophils and their role in CRDs. Moreover, it also discusses nanocarrier drug delivery systems for the targeted treatment of CRDs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate and consistent facial protective equipment (FPE) use iscritical for preventing respiratory illness transmission. Little is known aboutFPE adherence by home care providers. The purpose of this study is to adapt anexisting facial protection questionnaire and use it to develop an initialunderstanding of factors influencing home care providers' adherence to FPE duringthe COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey was shared with home care providersduring Wave 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario. Descriptive statistics andlogistic regression by FPE adherence were conducted across individual,organizational, and environmental factors. RESULTS: Of the 199 respondents (140personal support workers; 59 nurses), 71% reported that they always used FPE asrequired, with greater adherence to masks (89%) than eye protection (73%). Thealways-adherent reported greater perceived FPE efficacy, knowledge of recommendeduse and perceived occupational risk, lower education, and not experiencingpersonal barriers (including difficulty seeing, discomfort, communicationchallenges). DISCUSSION: Adherence rates were relatively high. In this context,with participants reporting high levels of organizational support,individual-level factors were the significant predictors of adherence.CONCLUSIONS: Initiatives addressing perceived FPE efficacy, knowledge ofrecommended use, perception of at-work risk, and personal barriers to use mayimprove FPE adherence.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective surgeries nationwidewere suspended. The objective is to compare temporal trends in patientdemographics, case volumes, and postoperative complications of patientsundergoing elective cervical spine surgery from pre-COVID (2019-2020Q1) topost-COVID (2020Q2-Q4). METHODS: The 2019 to 2020 ACS-NSQIP database was queried for common elective cervical spine surgeries. Patients pre-COVID (2019-2020Q1)were compared with those undergoing surgery during post-COVID (2020Q2-Q4)protocols. Procedural utilization, patient demographics, and complications werecompared. Linear regression was used to evaluate case volume changes over time. Pvalues less than 0.05 were significant. RESULTS: In total, 31,013 patientsunderwent elective cervical spine surgery in 2019 (N= 16,316) and 2020(N=14,697); an overall 10% decline. Compared to the calendar year 2019 through2020Q1 mean, elective surgery volume decreased by 21.6% in 2020Q2 and neverreturned to pre-pandemic baseline. The percentage decline in case volume from2019-2020Q1 to 2020Q2 was greatest for ACDF (23.3%), followed by cervicaldecompression (23.4%), posterior cervical fusion (15.0%), and cervical discarthroplasty and vertebral corpectomy (13.7%). Patients undergoing surgery in2020Q2-Q4 had overall higher comorbidity burden (ASA Class 3 and 4) (p<0.001).From 2019-2020Q1 versus 2020Q2-Q4, there was a significant increase in totalcomplication (5.5% vs 6.8%, p<0.001), reoperation (1.9% vs 2.2%, p=0.048), andmortality (0.25% vs 0.37%, p=0.049) rates. CONCLUSION: Elective surgery declined drastically during the second quarter of 2020. Patients undergoing surgery duringthe pandemic had an overall higher comorbidity burden, resulting in increasedtotal complication and mortality rates over the study period.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Pre-Identified Homeopathic Medicines in AsymptomaticCOVID-19 Individuals Receiving Standard Care-An Open-Label, Randomized,Controlled Exploratory Trial.
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1745754 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects can transmit theinfection for as many as 14 days and are regarded as a significant factor in the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. This exploratory study aimed to determine any additional benefits of selected homeopathic medicines compared with placeboin asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals receiving standard care. METHODS: Thisopen-label, randomized, placebo-controlled, exploratory trial was undertaken at aCOVID Care Centre (CCC) in Madhya Pradesh, India. Patients (n = 200, 18-65 years,both sexes) having a positive RT-PCR and asymptomatic during admission wereenrolled. They were randomly assigned to one of four groups (each n = 50):Arsenicum album 30C (Ars. alb.), Camphora 1M (Camph.), Bryonia alba 30C (Bry.alb.) and placebo (Pl.). All the patients were given standard care. The primaryoutcome was the number of patients becoming RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 atdays 5, 10 and 15. RESULTS: In total, 200 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients wereenrolled. One hundred and seventy-seven patients became RT-PCR negative by day15; 88%, 80%, 98% and 88% from Ars. alb., Camph., Bry. alb. and Pl. respectively.A Chi-square test of association for the total patients who became RT-PCRnegative for SARS-Cov-2 in each group showed a marginal statistical significance (Chi-square: 8.1, p = 0.04). A two-proportion Z-test comparing eachpre-identified homeopathic medicine with placebo showed marginal statisticalsignificance (p = 0.05) for Bry alb. only. Median time in days to RT-PCR negative(Kaplan Meier analysis) was 10 days in each of the groups. CONCLUSION: There was some evidence that, compared with Ars alb., Camph. or Pl., Bry. alb. wasassociated with an increased number of patients who became RT-PCR negative forCOVID-19 by day 15. The possible effect exerted needs to be investigated inadditional research.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, and humancoronavirus (hCoV)-NL63 utilize ACE2 as the functional receptor for cell entry,which leads to zoonotic infection. Horses (Equus caballus) attracted ourattention because the spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2and SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses bind equine ACE2 (eACE2) with high affinity.Here we show that eACE2 binds the RBDs of these three coronaviruses and alsoSARS-CoV-2 variants but with lower affinities compared with human ACE2 (hACE2).Structural analysis and mutation assays indicated that eACE2-H41 accounts for thelower binding affinity of eACE2 to the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma), SARS-CoV, and hCoV-NL63. Pseudovirus infection assays showed that theSARS-CoV-2 Delta strain (B.1.617.2) displayed a significantly increased infectionefficiency in eACE2-expressing HeLa cells. Our results reveal the molecular basisof eACE2 binding to the RBDs of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-NL63, whichprovides insights into the potential animal transmission of these ACE2-dependent coronaviruses.

TI  - Treatments in Ischemic Stroke: Current and Future.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1159/000525822 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Despite progress made over the last 30 years, stroke is stilla leading cause of disability and mortality; likewise, its burden is expected to increase over the next decades, due to population growth and aging. Thedevelopment of drugs with better safety-efficacy profiles as well as strategiesable to improve ischemic stroke management from the pre-hospital setting isneeded. SUMMARY: The pathophysiology of ischemic stroke involves multiplepathways resulting in cerebral artery obstruction and brain tissue ischemia. Todate, the only approved drug for acute ischemic stroke is intravenousthrombolytic alteplase. Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) can be administered alone or in combination with endovascular treatment (EVT) with mechanical thrombectomy,in case of large vessel occlusion and generally within 6 h from symptoms onset.The risk of potential bleeding complications, especially symptomaticintracerebral hemorrhage, is one of the reasons for the reluctance to administer IVT. Tenecteplase is a promising alternative fibrinolytic agent, having a better safety profile than alteplase. Moreover, recent evidences have allowed anextension of the IVT +/- EVT time window for patients with unknown onset time andfor those with a known onset time thanks to the new "tissue-window" approachguided by advanced neuroimaging techniques, which also helps in collateralcirculation estimation. Regarding primary-secondary prevention, researchers arefocused on improving the efficacy of antithrombotic drugs with a"hemostasis-sparing" approach. Neuroprotective agents are also under development,particularly stem cells. The COVID-19 pandemic has critically stressed globalhealthcare systems, with collateral damage resulting in access delivery of onlyemergency care, such as ischemic stroke. Regarding telemedicine, it has had aminor role in acute stroke management, and with the onset of COVID-19, this role will most likely be adopted to increase access and delivery in stroke assessment,but also in the follow-up.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed healthcare workers(HCW) to traumatic situations that might lead to the development of posttraumaticstress disorder (PTSD). An important vulnerability factor for PTSD is theperitraumatic tonic immobility (TI) reaction, an involuntary and reflexivedefensive response evoked by an intense and inescapable threat. TI is largelyunderstudied in humans and has not been investigated during trauma related toCOVID-19. For HCW, the pandemic context might be experienced as an intense andpotentially inescapable threat, i.e., an overwhelming situation. Here, weinvestigated if TI response occurred during traumatic events related to thepandemic and its association with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). An onlinesurvey of 1001 HCW investigated COVID-19-related traumatic experiences, TI andPTSS. TI was reported for all types of traumatic events, and multivariateregression models revealed that TI was significantly associated with PTSSseverity. HCW who reported high TI scores exhibited an increase of 9.08 times theprobability of having a probable diagnosis of PTSD. Thus, TI was evoked bypandemic-related traumatic situations and associated with PTSS severity andhigher odds of a PTSD diagnosis. Tonic immobility occurrence should be screened, and psychoeducation about its reflexive biological nature should be introduced.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interferon-beta, a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for MS, may beassociated with less severe COVID-19 in people with MS. RESULTS: Among 5,568patients (83.4% confirmed COVID-19), interferon-treated patients had lower riskof severe COVID-19 compared to untreated, but not to glatiramer-acetate,dimethyl-fumarate, or pooled other DMTs. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to otherDMTs, we did not find evidence of protective effects of interferon-beta on theseverity of COVID-19, though compared to the untreated, the course of COVID19 wasmilder among those on interferon-beta. This study does not support the use ofinterferon-beta as a treatment to reduce COVID-19 severity in MS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no major tools that could predict disease severity inCOVID-19. The aim of this study is to evaluate if serum galectin-3 levels canidentify disease progression in COVID-19. METHODS: Patients that werehospitalized due to COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were included in thiscross-sectional prospective study. Baseline demographic and clinical data inaddition to levels of serum parameters including galectin-3 were measured at the time of hospital admission. Patients with COVID-19 were categorized into twogroups (non-severe and severe illness). The need for ICU during hospital stay,duration from hospital admission to the transfer to the ICU, and the total lengthof hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included inthe study and among these, 64 patients formed the severe illness group whereas111 comprised the non-severe illness group. There was statistically significantdifference in terms of galectin-3 levels between groups (1.07 +/- 0.75 vs 0.484+/- 0.317, p < 0.0001, respectively). Our results showed that galectin-3, IL-6and CRP levels at admission were independent risk factors associated withtransfer to the ICU whereas only galectin-3 was an independent factor for theneed for advanced ventilatory support. Also, galectin-3 and IL-6 were independentrisk factors related to in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, ourresults indicated that galectin-3 had moderate power in outlining diseaseseverity and the need for ICU transfer throughout the clinical course inCOVID-19.

AB  - Antimicrobials like parabens, triclosan (TCS), and triclocarban (TCC) are ofpublic health concern worldwide due to their endocrine-disrupting properties and ability to promote antimicrobial drug resistance in human pathogens. The overall use of antimicrobials presumably has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic,whereas TCS and TCC may have experienced reductions in use due to their recentban from thousands of over-the-counter (OTC) personal care products by the U.S.Food and Drug Administration (FDA). No quantitative data are available on the useof parabens or the impact the FDA ban had on TCC and TCS. Here, we use wastewatersamples (n = 1514) from 10 different communities in Arizona to measure thepresence of the six different antimicrobial products (TCS, TCC, and fouralkylated parabens [methylparaben (MePb), ethylparaben (EtPb), propylparaben(PrPb), butylparaben (BuPb)]) collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemicusing a combination of solid-phase extraction, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and isotope dilution for absolute quantitation. Theaverage mass loadings of all antimicrobials combined (1,431 +/- 22 mg/day per1,000 people) after the onset of the local epidemic (March 2020 - October 2020)were significantly higher (945 +/- 62 mg/day per 1,000 people; p < 0.05) thanbefore the pandemic (January 2019 - February 2020). Overall, parabens ( summationoperatorPbs = 999 +/- 16 mg/day per 1,000 people) were the most usedantimicrobials, followed by TCS (117 +/- 14 mg/day per 1,000 people) and TCC (117+/- 14 mg/day per 1,000 people). After the 2017 U.S. FDA ban, we found astatistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the mass loadings of TCS (-89%)and TCC (-80%) but a rise in paraben use (+72%). Mass flows of 3 of a total of 4 parabens (MePb, EtPb, and PrPb) in wastewater were significantly higher upon the onset of the epidemic locally (p < 0.05). This is the first longitudinal studyinvestigating the use of antimicrobials during the COVID-19 pandemic by employingwastewater-based epidemiology. Whereas an overall increase in the use ofantimicrobials was evident from analyzing Arizona wastewater, a notable reductionin the use of TCS and TCC was evident during the pandemic, triggered by the U.S. FDA ban.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the significance of readily available andeasily performed viral testing for surveillance during future infectiouspandemics. The objectives of this study were: to assess the performance of theXpert Xpress Flu and/or RSV test, a multiplex PCR assay for detecting influenza Aand B virus and respiratory syncytial virus nucleic acids in respiratory tractspecimens, relative to the Quidel Lyra Influenza A+B assay and the ProdesseProFlu+ assay, and the system's ease of use by minimally trained operators.Overall, the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV test demonstrated a high positive and negative percent agreement with the comparator assays, and was easy to use and interpretresults, based on the operators' feedback. We concluded that the Xpert XpressFlu/RSV test is sensitive, specific, and easy to use for the diagnosis ofinfluenza and RSV by minimally trained operators and can be a valuable tool infuture infectious clusters or pandemics.

AB  - Physician wellness was greatly impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Busyclinical services, personal safety concerns, changing guidelines, and compassion fatigue weighed on physicians. Although studies have examined physician wellness,few have studied how it changed over time. A survey about wellness wasdistributed to 299 physicians at Ascension St. Vincent Hospital-IndianapolisMarch 2020, July 2020, November 2020, and March 2021. Physicians also free-textedabout their well-being during the pandemic. Participation rates over the fourtime periods averaged 22.23%. Responses were compared among the time periodsusing Pearson Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact Tests. Six wellness factors (anxiety,worry about becoming ill, worry about infecting family, worry about caring forchildren, concern about personal finances) were reported as worse after thepandemic began, but statistically significantly improved over the course of thestudy. In contrast, seven wellness measures (increased issues with depression,frustration, hopelessness, fatigue, dread going to work, worry about missingwork, worry about caring for family), that also worsened after the pandemicbegan, did not statistically improve over time. Physician wellness was impactedby the pandemic; however, not all measures followed the same course over time.Longitudinal assessments of wellness can help inform programs to best supportphysicians.

AB  - The increased transmissibility of the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virusresulted in a rapid increase in infection among many psychiatric inpatients inour hospital between December 2021 and February 2022. This required ourinstitution to close affected units to new admissions. In response, weimplemented a model utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction(PCR) testing at the time of admission, the development of "admitting units"where all patients were quarantined for four days followed by repeat PCR testing,and subsequent transition to COVID-19 negative and COVID-19 positive "receivingunits" based on the results of the second test. No unit closures occurredfollowing full implementation of the model.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities related to the digital divide.With wide adoption of remote working and learning, telehealth, and virtual eventsand social activities, the technology have-nots and know-nots experiencedsubstantial marginalization and elevated risks of COVID-19 exposure in dailylives. This study discusses the pathways through which digital exclusion couldaggravate the impacts of the pandemic and explored the linkage between digitalaccess and COVID-19 outcomes in U.S. counties. It finds that counties with higherpercentages of digitally excluded populations have seen higher COVID-19 case and death rates throughout the pandemic and lower vaccination rates by January 2022.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aims at observing placental pathologies in COVID-19infected women, and analyzing its impact on pregnancy outcome. METHOD: This is a descriptive-analytical study done at a tertiary centre of Northern India. AllCOVID-19 positive pregnant women with gestational age >/=20 weeks, with placentalhistopathological reporting, were included in this study. A total of 173 COVID-19pregnant women were included in the study. RESULTS: Placental abnormalities were noticed in 49.16% of total 179 placentae examined. Maternal vascular malperfusion(27.93%) was the most observed placental pathology followed by villous fibrindeposits (22.90%), fetal vasculopathy (16.75%), and acute inflammation (6.70%).Stillbirths were 22 and NICU admissions were seen in 50 neonates. Abnormalplacental abnormalities led to higher stillbirths (p value 0.011) and lower Apgarscores at 1 and 5 min (p-value 0.028; p-value 0.002, respectively). Intervillous fibrin deposits had higher risk associated with lower Apgar score at 1 and 5 min [RR 2.05 (95% CI 1.21-3.48, p-value 0.010) and RR 5.52 (95% CI 2.58-11.81,p-value <0.001), respectively]. RP clot/hemorrhage was also associated with lowerApgar score at 1 and 5 min [RR 2.61 (95% CI 1.52-4.49, p-value 0.002) and RR 3.54(95% CI 1.66-7.55, p-value 0.001), respectively]. DISCUSSION: Placentalabnormalities in COVID-19 infection were associated with significant higherincidence of unexplained stillbirths, and lower Apgar scores. Although, this isthe largest descriptive-analytical study done so far, comparative studies arerequired to draw a clear conclusion regarding the impact of COVID-19 infection onhuman placenta and its effect on pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Rational detection of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial toprevention, control, and treatment of disease. Herein, a dual-wavelengthratiometric electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on resonance energytransfer (RET) between g-C3N4 nanosheets and Ru-SiO2@folic acid (FA)nanomaterials was designed to realize ultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2virus (RdRp gene). Firstly, the unique g-C3N4 nanosheets displayed very intenseand stable ECL at 460 nm, then the triple helix DNA was stably and verticallybound to g-C3N4 on electrode by high binding affinity between ssDNA and g-C3N4.Meanwhile, trace amounts of target genes were converted to a large number ofoutput by three-dimensional (3D) DNA walker multiple amplification, and theoutput bridged a multifunctional probe Ru-SiO2@FA to electrode. Ru-SiO2@FA notonly showed high ECL at 620 nm, but also effectively quenched g-C3N4 ECL. As aresult, ECL decreased at 460 nm and increased at 620 nm, which was used to designa rational ECL biosensor for detection of SARS gene. The results show that thebiosensor has excellent detection sensitivity for RdRp gene with a dynamicdetection range of 1 fM to 10 nM and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.18 fM. Thedual-wavelength ratio ECL biosensor has inestimable value and applicationprospects in the fields of biosensing and clinical diagnosis.

AB  - The researchers assessed the delay in referral of pregnant women and childrenunder five years old during the COVID-19 pandemic that they require regularhealthcare. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021 in Fars, Iran. Atotal of 591 households with pregnant women and children under five years oldwere recruited, then having delay and the number of their delays in regularvisits during the COVID-19 outbreak was asked. A total of 153 children under fiveyears old (51.7%) and 93 pregnant women (31.5%) reported delays in referral. Inchildren, higher age and referral to the family physician and private clinic, andin pregnant women, higher gestational age and pregnancy rank and having healthproblems (e.g., preeclampsia in the current pregnancy) significantly enhanced thenumber of delays. Due to the vulnerability of these groups, it is necessary toconsider active care for them as a priority at the primary care level.

TI  - Better understanding the behavior of air pollutants at shutdown times - resultsof a short full lockdown.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/09603123.2022.2105310 [doi]
AB  - Numerous studies have evaluated the effects of lockdowns during the COVID-19pandemic, but most of them have concerned large cities and regions. This studyaimed to evaluate the dynamics of air pollutants during and after theimplementation of a short lockdown in the medium-sized city of Pelotas, Brazil,using hourly measurements of pollutants. The evaluation period included in thisstudy was between August 9(th) and 12(th), 2020. A machine learning model wasused to investigate the expected behavior against what was observed during thestudy period. All pollutants presented a gradual reduction until a dynamicplateau established 48 hours after the start of the lockdown: NO2 ( downwardarrow4%), O3 ( downward arrow34%), SO2 ( downward arrow24%), CO ( downwardarrow48%), PM10 ( downward arrow82%) and PM2.5 ( downward arrow82%). At the endof the restriction measures, the PM10 and PM2.5 levels continued to declinebeyond expectations. Our findings show that these measures can positively affect the air quality in medium-sized cities.

TI  - Empowering Healthcare Workers on Social Media to Bolster Trust in Science andVaccination During the Pandemic: Making IMPACT Using a Place-Based Approach.
LID - 10.2196/38949 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given widespread and concerted efforts to propagate healthmisinformation on social media, particularly centered around vaccination duringthe pandemic, many groups of clinicians and scientists organized on social media to tackle misinformation and promote vaccination using a national orinternational lens. While documenting the impact of such social media efforts,particularly at the community level, can be challenging, a more hyperlocal or"place-based approach" for social media campaigns could be effective at tackling misinformation and improving public health outcomes on a community level.OBJECTIVE: To describe and document the effectiveness of a place-based strategyfor a coordinated group of healthcare workers on social media from Chicago totackle misinformation and improve vaccination rates in the communities theyserve. METHODS: The Illinois Medical Professionals Action Collaborative Team(IMPACT) was founded in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic withrepresentatives from major academic teaching hospitals in Chicago (University of Chicago, Northwestern University, University of Illinois, Rush University) andcommunity-based organizations. Through crowdsourcing on multiple social mediaplatforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) with a place-based approach, IMPACTengaged grassroots networks of thousands of Illinois healthcare workers and thepublic to identify gaps, needs, and viewpoints to improve local healthcaredelivery during the pandemic. RESULTS: To address vaccine misinformation, IMPACT created 8 "myth debunking" infographics and 14 informational vaccine infographicsthat have generated >340K impressions and informed the development of vaccineeducation for the Chicago Public Libraries. IMPACT delivered 13 policy lettersfocusing on different topics (i.e. healthcare worker personal protectiveequipment, universal masking, vaccination) with >4000 healthcare workers (HCWs)signatures collected through social media to policymakers, published over 50op-eds on COVID-19 topics in high impact news outlets, and contributed to >200local and national news features. Using the crowdsourcing approach on IMPACTsocial media channels, IMPACT mobilized healthcare and lay volunteers to staff > 400 vaccine events for > 120,000 individuals, many in Chicago's hardest-hitneighborhoods. The group's recommendations have influenced public healthawareness campaigns and initiatives, research, advocacy, and policyrecommendations, and have been recognized with local and national awards.CONCLUSIONS: A coordinated group of healthcare workers on social media using ahyperlocal place-based approach can not only work together to addressmisinformation but can also collaborate to boost vaccination rates in theirsurrounding communities.

TI  - Factors Associated With the Utilization of Outpatient Virtual Clinics:Retrospective Observational Study Using Multilevel Analysis.
LID - 10.2196/40288 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic hasaccelerated the adoption of telemedicine and virtual consultations globally,complex factors that may affect the use of virtual clinics are still unclear.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with the utilizationof virtual clinics in the experience of virtual clinic service implementation in Taiwan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a total of 187,742 outpatient visits(176815 in-person visits and 10,972 virtual visits) completed at a large general hospital in Taipei City from May 19 to July 31, 2021 after rapid implementationof virtual outpatient clinic visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data ofpatients' demographic characteristics, disease type, physicians' features andspecialties/departments were collected; and physicians' opinions regardingvirtual clinics were surveyed and evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale.Multilevel analysis was conducted to determine the factors associated with theutilization of virtual clinics. RESULTS: Patient/visit-level, physician-level,and department-level factors accounted for 67.5%, 11.1%, and 21.4% of the totalvariance in the utilization of virtual clinics, respectively. Female sex (oddsratio [OR]=1.27, P<.001), residing at a greater distance away from the hospital(OR=2.36 if distance >50 km, P<.001; OR=3.95 if extensive travel required,P<.001), reimbursement by the National Health Insurance (OR=7.29, P<.001),seeking care for a major chronic disease (OR=1.33, P<.001), physician's positive attitude about virtual clinics (OR=1.50, P=.002), and visits within certaindepartments including the heart center, psychiatry, and internal medicine(OR=2.55, P =.004) were positively associated with the utilization of virtualclinics. Patient's age, physician's age, and physician's sex were not associated with the utilization of virtual clinics in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Our resultsshow that in addition to previously demonstrated patient-level factors that mayinfluence telemedicine use, including patient's sex and distance from thehospital, factors at visit-level (insurance type, disease type), physician-level (physician's attitude about virtual clinics), and department-level alsocontribute to the utilization of virtual clinics. Although there was a more than 300-fold increase in number of virtual visits during the pandemic compared withpre-pandemic period, the majority (176815/187742, 94.2%) of the outpatient visitswere still in-person visits during the study period. Therefore, it is of greatimportance to understand the factors impacting the utilization of virtual clinicsto accelerate the implementation of telemedicine. The findings of our study mayhelp direct policymaking for expanding the use of virtual clinics, especially in countries struggling with the development and promotion of telemedicine virtualclinic services.

TI  - Conceptual Framework for Cancer Care During a Pandemic Incorporating EvidenceFrom the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - e2200043
LID - 10.1200/GO.22.00043 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: With successive infection waves and the spread of more infectiousvariants, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have major impacts on health care.To achieve best outcomes for patients with cancer during a pandemic, efforts tominimize the increased risk of severe pandemic infection must be carefullybalanced against unintended adverse impacts of the pandemic on cancer care, with consideration to available health system capacity. Cancer Australia's conceptual framework for cancer care during a pandemic provides a planning resource forhealth services and policy-makers that can be broadly applied globally and tosimilar pandemics. METHODS: Evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic oncancer care and health system capacity to June 2021 was reviewed, and theconceptual framework was developed and updated. RESULTS: Components of healthsystem capacity vary during a pandemic, and capacity relative to pandemic numbersand severity affects resources available for cancer care delivery. The challengesof successive pandemic waves and high numbers of pandemic cases necessitateconsideration of changing health system capacity in decision making about cancer care. Cancer Australia's conceptual framework provides guidance on continuationof care across the cancer pathway, in the face of challenges to health systems,while minimizing infection risk for patients with cancer and unintendedconsequences of delays in screening, diagnosis, and cancer treatment and backlogsbecause of service interruption. CONCLUSION: Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic supports continuation of cancer care wherever possible during similar pandemics. Cancer Australia's conceptual framework, underpinned by principles for optimalcancer care, informs decision making across the cancer care continuum. Itincorporates consideration of changes in health system capacity and capacity for cancer care, in relation to pandemic progression, enabling broad applicability todifferent global settings.

AB  - The present study was conducted to assess the short-term effects of themeteorological factors on the COVID-19 mortality in Qom, Iran. The GAM with aquasi-Poisson link function was used to evaluate the impact of temperature, DTR, relative humidity, and absolute humidity on the COVID-19 mortality, controllingpotential confounders such as time trend, air pollutants, and day of the week.The results showed that the risk of COVID-19 mortality was reduced, in single-daylag/multiple-day average lag, per one-unit increase in absolute humidity(percentage change in lag 0=-33.64% (95% CI (-42.44, -23.49)), and relativehumidity (percentage change in lag 0=-1.87% (95% CI (-2.52, -1.22)). Also, perone-unit increase in DTR value, COVID death risk increased in single-day andmultiple-day average lag. This study demonstrated a significant relationshipbetween the four meteorological variables and the COVID-19 mortality.

TI  - Issues with Variability in EHR Data About Race and Ethnicity: A DescriptiveAnalysis of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative Data Enclave.
LID - 10.2196/39235 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The adverse impact of COVID-19 on marginalized and under-resourcedcommunities of color has highlighted the need for accurate, comprehensive raceand ethnicity data. However, a significant technical challenge related tointegrating race and ethnicity data in large, consolidated databases is the lack of consistency in how data about race and ethnicity is collected and structuredby healthcare organizations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and describe variations inhow healthcare systems collect and report information about the race andethnicity of their patients, and to assess how well these data are integratedwhen aggregated into a large clinical database. METHODS: At the time of ouranalysis, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Data Enclave containedrecords from 6.5 million patients contributed by 56 healthcare institutions. Wequantified the variability in the harmonized race and ethnicity data in the N3CEnclave by analyzing its conformance to healthcare standards for such data. Weconducted a descriptive analysis by comparing the harmonized data available forresearch purposes in the database to the original source data contributed byhealthcare institutions. To make the comparison, we tabulated the original sourcecodes, enumerating how many patients had been reported with each encoded valueand how many distinct ways each category was reported. The non-conforming datawas also cross-tabulated by three factors: patient ethnicity, the number of data partners using each code, and which data models utilized those particularencodings. For the non-conforming data, we used an inductive approach to sort thesource encodings into categories. For example, values such as "Declined" weregrouped with "Refused"; "Multiple Race" was grouped with "Two or more races" and "Multiracial", etc. RESULTS: "No matching concept" was the second largestharmonized concept used by the N3C to describe the race of patients in theirdatabase. 20.7% of the race data did not conform to the standard; the largestcategory was data that were missing. Hispanic or Latino patients wereover-represented in the non-conforming racial data, and data from American Indianor Alaska Native patients were obscured. Although only a small proportion of the source data had not been mapped to the correct concepts (0.6%), Black orAfrican-American and Hispanic/Latino patients were over-represented in thiscategory. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in how race and ethnicity data isconceptualized and encoded by healthcare institutions can affect the quality ofthe data in aggregated clinical databases. The impact of data quality issues inthe N3C Data Enclave was not equal across all races and ethnicities, which hasthe potential to introduce bias in analyses and conclusions drawn from thesedata. Transparency about how data has been transformed can help users makeaccurate analyses and inferences, and eventually better guide clinical care andpublic policy.

TI  - Veterinary students' views on surgical entrustable professional activities andthe impact of COVID-19 on clinical competence development.
PG  - e1978
LID - 10.1002/vetr.1978 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary purpose of this study was to understand veterinarystudents' views on the described key surgical entrustable professional activities(EPAs) and to understand how COVID-19 restrictions have impacted their clinicalskill and competence development. METHODS: Final-year veterinary students at asingle institute completed a web-based survey distributed by email. The surveyaimed to characterise five constructs regarding EPAs, and a specific five-pointLikert-like scale was created asking explicitly worded questions for eachconstruct. RESULTS: One hundred and ten students responded. The cohort agreedthat the previously described key surgical EPAs were clinically important andrelevant, but over 50% of the respondents felt that they had no substantialexperience with them and were not confident or comfortable performing them.Additionally, most students (95%) felt their clinical development was negatively impacted by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that the keyEPAs proposed are considered important skills by the undergraduate cohortdescribed and that experience levels when entering the final year are lacking,potentially due to reduced exposure to clinical cases influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac613 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has been replaced by the highlytransmissible Omicron BA.1 variant, and subsequently by Omicron BA.2. It isimportant to understand how these changes in dominant variants affect reportedsymptoms, while also accounting for symptoms arising from other co-circulatingrespiratory viruses. METHODS: In a nationally representative UK community study, the COVID-19 Infection Survey, we investigated symptoms in PCR-positive infectionepisodes vs. PCR-negative study visits over calendar time, by age and vaccinationstatus, comparing periods when the Delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants weredominant. RESULTS: Between October-2020 and April-2022, 120,995 SARS-CoV-2PCR-positive episodes occurred in 115,886 participants, with 70,683 (58%)reporting symptoms. The comparator comprised 4,766,366 PCR-negative study visits (483,894 participants); 203,422 (4%) reporting symptoms. Symptom reporting inPCR-positives varied over time, with a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell asOmicron BA.1 dominated, maintained with BA.2 (44%/45% 17 October 2021, 16%/13% 2 January 2022, 15%/12% 27 March 2022). Cough, fever, shortness of breath, myalgia,fatigue/weakness and headache also decreased after Omicron BA.1 dominated, butsore throat increased, the latter to a greater degree than concurrent increasesin PCR-negatives. Fatigue/weakness increased again after BA.2 dominated, althoughto a similar degree to concurrent increases in PCR-negatives. Symptoms wereconsistently more common in adults aged 18-65 years than in children or olderadults. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in sore throat (also common in the generalcommunity), and a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell, make Omicron harder todetect with symptom-based testing algorithms, with implications for institutionaland national testing policies.

PG  - e24629
LID - 10.1002/jcla.24629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) is associated with various diseases.Several studies of CAS associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)reported hemolytic anemia and thrombosis; however, the clinical significance ofcold agglutinins (CA) in patients with COVID-19 is unclear. Here, we present two cases of CA identified in the context of COVID-19 without hemolytic anemia andclotting. CASE REPORT AND DISCUSSION: Two patients with no known risk factors forCA were diagnosed with COVID-19; peripheral blood smears reveal red blood cells(RBCs) agglutination. These patients showed a high CA titer. We confirmedretrospectively that the CA was an anti-I antibody. The two COVID-19 cases with ahigh CA titer showed no hemolysis or thrombosis. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is knownto cause CAS, but not all patients who have a high CA titer show hemolysis.Coagulation abnormalities are documented in severe COVID-19 cases. Although CAincreases the risk of thrombosis in those with lymphoproliferative diseases, the role of anti-I antibodies in COVID-19 is unclear. The impact of CAS on clinicalpresentations in COVID-19 remains a matter of verification. CONCLUSIONS: A highCA titer was identified in COVID-19 patients without hemolytic anemia andclotting. Anti-I antibodies were identified. Further studies are required toclarify the pathophysiology of CA in COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The exact animal origin of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains obscure and understanding its host range isvital for preventing interspecies transmission. METHODS: Herein, we appliedsingle-cell sequencing to multiple tissues of 20 species (30 data sets) andintegrated them with public resources (45 data sets covering 26 species) toexpand the virus receptor distribution investigation. While the binding affinity between virus and receptor is essential for viral infectivity, understanding the receptor distribution could predict the permissive organs and tissues wheninfection occurs. RESULTS: Based on the transcriptomic data, the expressionprofiles of receptor or associated entry factors for viruses capable of causingrespiratory, blood, and brain diseases were described in detail. Conservedcellular connectomes and regulomes were also identified, revealing fundamentalcell-cell and gene-gene cross-talks from reptiles to humans. CONCLUSIONS:Overall, our study provides a resource of the single-cell atlas of the animalkingdom which could help to identify the potential host range and tissue tropism of viruses and reveal the host-virus co-evolution.

TI  - The Implementation Gap in Emerging Disease Risk Management in the Wildlife Trade.
LID - 10.7589/JWD-D-21-00199 [doi]
AB  - The wildlife trade has been characterized as one of the biggest risk factors inthe emergence of new infectious diseases. In the shadow of COVID-19, there isgrowing political and scientific urgency to manage this risk. Existing studiesand experiences make it clear that something must be done but are less clear onhow to get it done. It is a quite different task to accumulate evidence on thepresence of pathogens, their locations in the supply chain, and their spilloverto new hosts than to identify effective ways to prevent and mitigate emergingdisease under real-world conditions. This study sought peer-reviewed evidence on the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability of riskreduction interventions for zoonotic and nonzoonotic disease emergence in thewildlife trade. An environmental scan triangulated information from a scopingreview following a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews andMeta-analysis extension for scoping review protocol, two narrative literaturereviews, and key informant interviews of 26 international wildlife healthexperts. Existing literature has been inattentive to program implementation orevaluation studies. There was insufficient evidence to identify effective andsustainable risk management actions. Studies on the effects of social,epidemiologic, and ecologic context on intervention success was lacking, as wasresearch using a complex systems perspective. The lack of systematic programevaluations or implementation studies leaves decision makers with insufficientevidence to select interventions likely to be acceptable, effective, andsustainable within and across the disparate context of the wildlife trade. Thisnecessitates adaptive risk management and innovations in program implementationand evaluation to ensure evidence-based risk management.

AB  - Background: We sought to examine health-care-associated infections (HAIs) amongpatients undergoing an appendectomy at academic medical centers (AMCs) andnon-AMCs during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) peri-pandemic. Wehypothesized that AMCs would have higher rates of post-operative HAIs during the first wave of the pandemic. Patients and Methods: We performed a post hocanalysis of a prospective, observational, multi-center study of patients aged >18years who underwent an appendectomy for acute appendicitis before (pre-CoV),during (CoV), and after pandemic restrictions were lifted (post-CoV). Patientswere grouped according to hospital type (AMC vs. non-AMC). Our primary outcomewas the incidence of post-operative HAIs. Results: There were 1,003 patients;69.5% (n = 697) were treated at AMCs and 30.5% (n = 306) at non-AMCs. Patients atAMCs had greater rates of concomitant COVID-19 infections (5.5% vs. 0.7%; p <0.0001) and worse operative appendicitis severity (p = 0.01). Greater rates ofHAIs were seen at AMCs compared with non-AMCs (4.9% vs. 2%; p = 0.03). Surgicalsite infections were the most common HAI and occurred more often at AMCs (4.3%vs. 1.6%; p = 0.04). Only during CoV were there more HAIs at AMCs (5.1% vs. 0.3%;p = 0.02). Undergoing surgery at an AMC during CoV was a risk factor for HAIs(adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-71.03; p =0.04). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, appendectomies performed atAMCs were an independent risk factor for post-operative HAIs. Our findings stressthe importance of adherence to standard infection prevention efforts duringfuture healthcare crises.

AB  - Social distancing reduces the transmission of COVID-19 and other airbornediseases. To test different ways to increase social distancing, we conducted afield experiment at a major US airport using a system that presented color-coded visual indicators on crowdedness. We complemented those visual indicators withnudges commonly used to increase COVID-19-preventive behaviors. Analyzing datafrom 57,146 travelers, we find that visual indicators and nudges significantlyaffected social distancing. Introducing visual indicators increased the share of travelers practicing social distancing, and this positive effect was enhanced by introducing nudges focused on personal benefits ("protect yourself") and publicbenefits ("protect others"). Conversely, an authoritative nudge referencing theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention ("don't break CDC COVID-19guidelines") did not change social distancing behavior. Our results demonstratethat visual indicators and informed nudges can boost social distancing andpotentially curb the spread of contagious diseases.

TI  - Contemporary nutrition-based interventions to reduce risk of infection amongelderly long-term care residents: A scoping review.
PG  - e0272513
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272513 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly long-term care residents (ELTCRs) face considerable burden ofinfection, especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. The nutritionalstatus of the host can influence susceptibility to infection by altering immunesystem integrity, therefore, nutrition-based interventions may be a viablecomplement to existing infection prevention measures. OBJECTIVE: This scopingreview sought to identify nutritional interventions and factors that have thestrongest evidence to benefit ELTCRs, and thus best poised for rigorous clinical trial evaluation and subsequent implementation. METHODS: A database search ofOVID-Medline, OVID-Embase, and Web of Science was performed from 2011 to 2021 to identify nutritional intervention studies which attribute to changes in infectionin contemporary ELTCR settings. Articles were screened in duplicate and dataextraction completed by a single reviewer, while a second reviewer verified thedata which was fitted to identify evidence for nutritional interventions related to reducing rates of infection among ELTCRs. RESULTS: The search identified 1018 studies, of which 11 (nine clinical trials and two observational cohort studies) satisfied screening criteria. Interventions that significantly reduced risk ofinfection included whey protein (any infection), Black Chokeberry (urinary tract infection), and vitamin D (acute respiratory tract infection, skin and softtissue infection). Both zinc and a dedicated meal-plan significantly improvedlymphocyte parameters. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with the developmentof respiratory tract infections. Probiotic and soy-based protein interventionsdid not significantly affect risk of infection or lymphocyte parameters,respectively. CONCLUSION: The current scoping review was effective in identifyingthe use of nutrition-based interventions for infection prevention among ELTCRs.In this study, some nutrition-based interventions were observed to significantly influence the risk of infection among ELTCRs. Nutritional interventions such asvitamin D (preventing deficiency/insufficiency), Black Chokeberry juice, zincgluconate, whey protein, and varied and nutrient dense meal plans may be suitablefor future rigorous clinical trial evaluation.

TI  - COVID-19 infection induces higher trust in strangers.
PG  - e2116818119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2116818119 [doi]
AB  - How does the COVID-19 pandemic affect interpersonal trust? Most evidence showsthat natural disasters reinforce trust and cooperation, but the COVID-19 virusdiffers from other calamities, since it spreads through contact with people,potentially increasing suspicion and distrust, as, according to contemporaneouswriters' accounts, seems to have been the case with the Black Death, the Londonplague, and the Spanish influenza. We investigate the link between interpersonal trust and individuals exposed to COVID-19, either vicariously through theircommunity or networks or directly by becoming infected. We rely on an originalpanel survey, including a survey experiment, with a representative sample ofadults in Italy, one of the countries hardest struck by the pandemic. Ourexperimental findings reveal that priming people about the risk that the pandemicposes to their health leads to a substantial increase in their trust instrangers. Our panel data analysis of within-individual effects shows that those who become infected trust strangers more than those who are not infected. Ourfindings could be explained by people observing higher than expected altruisticbehavior or becoming more dependent on other people's support, consistent withthe "emancipation theory of trust." When people recover from COVID-19, however,they drop to trusting strangers as much as those who were not directly exposed tothe virus, an indication that the positive effects on trust during the pandemichave an emotional source. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that, in theaggregate, there has been a small but significant increase in trust among thegeneral population relative to prepandemic levels.

AB  - Corruption is a global wicked problem that threatens the achievement of health,social and economic development goals, including Sustainable Development Goal #3: Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all. The COVID-19 pandemicand its resulting strain on health systems has heightened risks of corruptionboth generally and specifically within health systems. Over the past years,international organizations, including those instrumental to the global COVID-19 response, have increased efforts to address corruption within their operationsand related programs. However, as attention to anti-corruption efforts isrelatively recent within international organizations, there is a lack ofliterature examining how these organizations address corruption and the impact oftheir anti-corruption efforts. This study addresses this gap by examining howaccountability, transparency, and anti-corruption are taken up by internationalorganizations within their own operations and the reported outcomes of suchefforts. The following international organizations were selected as the focus of this document analysis: the World Health Organization, the Global Fund, theUnited Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank Group. Documents wereidentified through a targeted search of each organization's website. Documentswere then analyzed combining elements of content analysis and thematic analysis. The findings demonstrate that accountability and transparency mechanisms havebeen employed by each of the four international organizations to addresscorruption. Further, these organizations commonly employed oversight mechanisms, including risk assessments, investigations, and audits to monitor their internal and external operations for fraud and corruption. All organizations used sanctionstrategies meant to reprimand identified transgressors and deter futurecorruption. Findings also demonstrate a marked increase in anti-corruptionefforts by these international organizations in recent years. Though this ispromising, there remains a distinct absence of evidence demonstrating the impact of such efforts on the prevalence and severity of corruption in internationalorganizations.

PG  - e0271196
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271196 [doi]
AB  - This paper aims to deal with the impact of COVID-19 on the livelihoods ofdisadvantaged persons living in slums in Kenya. Months after the first case ofCOVID-19 was reported in Kenya in March 2020, most of the studies that have been carried out pertaining to its impact on slum dwellers have concentrated onnarrowly defined concerns e.g. the impact of COVID-19 on youth, gender basedviolence and nutrition. It is thus difficult to get a clear global picture of theoverall impact of COVID-19 on the livelihoods of slum dwellers in Kenya. Thispaper relies on information gathered during a comprehensive qualitative microstudy covering numerous aspects of slum dwellers' livelihoods, as well asinformation that has been produced by the Ministry of Health, civil societyorganizations that work in specific slums, private research organizations as wellas local and foreign media houses. The slums whose information is reported inthis paper were selected to be indicative of the over 300 slums that are located in Nairobi and Mombasa, the two most important cities in Kenya. The analysisconcludes that slum dwellers were potentially at a higher risk under thepressures of COVID-19 of deteriorating conditions with regard to the provision ofhealth services, employment, gender-based violence, education and youth-relatedproblems, and human rights violations, and offers several recommendations to the government.

AB  - The current Covid-19 pandemic has a profound impact on all aspects of our lives. Aside from contagion by aerosols, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 is ubiquitous onsurfaces that millions of people handle daily. Therefore, controlling thispandemic involves the reduction of potential infections via contaminatedsurfaces. We developed antiviral surfaces by preparing suspensions of copper and cupric oxide nanoparticles in two different polymer matrices, poly(methylmethacrylate) and polyepoxide. For total copper contents as low as 5%, thecomposite material showed remarkable antiviral properties against the HCoV-OC43human coronavirus and against a model lentivirus and proved well-resistant toaccelerated aging conditions. Importantly, we showed that the Cu/CuO mixtureshowed optimal performances. This product can be implemented to produce a simple and inexpensive coating with long-term antiviral properties and will open the wayto developing surface coatings against a broad spectrum of pathogens includingSARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Medical facility equality is a critical metric for determining equal access tomedical care. Their spatial distribution is important for effective pandemictreatment and daily prevention in cities. This paper used the Kernel DensityTwo-Step Floating Catchment Area (KD2SFCA) and shortest distance methods tocalculate the accessibility of designated COVID-19 Fangcang hospitals and feverclinics in the Wuhan Metropolitan Development Zone. Their equality was evaluated by the Gini coefficient and Lorentz curve. Several results were obtained: (1) Thefacilities' accessibility declines radial from the central to peripheral areas.(2) Most of the demand points in the study area can reach the medical facilities for COVID-19 pandemic treatment within 60 minutes. (3) For the spatialdistribution of these facilities, the equality evaluated for different timethresholds differed significantly, with long time thresholds having betterequality than for short time thresholds. (4) While the distances distribution of fever clinics is balanced, the equality gap in various areas remains enormouswhen considering population distribution. Suggestions for optimizing the spatial distribution of pandemic treatment medical facilities in Wuhan are proposed, and which will serve as references for the planning of Wuhan's pandemic medicalfacilities in the future.

AB  - Introduction COVID- 19 is a disease that has claimed the lives of many people.However, alterations in labo-ratory profiles in the city of Tacna have not beenaccurately established in association with its severity to support diagnosis and treatment. Objective To determine biomarkers related to the severity of COVID- 19in patients treated at the social security hospital in Tacna during 2020. MethodsWe performed an observational, cross- sectional, and analytical study thatincluded 308 patients with COVID- 19 from the social security hospital in Tacna, Peru, during the "first wave" of the pandemic (from July to August 2020).Immunological, hematological, arterial gas, hemostasis, and biochemical markerswere collected. Patients were categorized into mild, moderate, and severe basedon the clinical criteria found on clinical records. Correlation strength wasper-formed according to Spearman's Rho coefficient. The performance of thebiomarkers associat-ed with severity was analyzed with the Receiver OperatingCharacteristic curve. Results Regarding hematological markers there was apositive correlation with monocyte count (correla-tion coefficient: 0.841; areaunder the curve 97.0%; p < 0.05) and a negative correlation with lymphocyte count(correlation coefficient: -0.622; area under the curve 82.7%; p < 0.05).Regarding biochemical markers, arterial gases and hemostasis, no significantcorrelations were found. In immunological markers, we found positive correlation with ferritin (correlation coef-ficient: 0.805; area under the curve 94.0%; p <0.05), and C- reactive protein (correlation coeffi-cient: 0.587; area under thecurve 87.4%; p < 0.05). Conclusions The biomarkers that can be considered asparameters associated with the severity of COVID- 19 are the absolute blood countof monocytes and serum ferritin concentration.

LID - e002555 [pii]
AB  - Introduction The COVID- 19 pandemic discontinued sexual and reproductive healthcare in Chile and the world. The national focus on hospital care led primary careteams to respond in natural and diverse ways. Understanding the factors involved in this process may improve future responses from the judgment of good practices.Therefore, this study aimed to identify and systematize sexual and reproductivehealth initiatives raised by primary care teams in response to the COVID- 19pandemic in Chile. Methods We systematically evaluated initiatives and practices in sexual and reproductive health in prima-ry care between June 2020 and November2021. This study was developed in three methodological phases: a review ofdocuments, a collection of experiences through an electronic instrument sent tothe 29 health services in Chile, and in-depth interviews. According to bestpractice criteria, mapping and characterizing the initiatives and criticaldiscourse analysis of narratives and interviews were carried out. ResultsForty-one initiatives from 19 health services were identified, mainly from theSouth Central macro zone and urban areas. In these areas, care was recognized.These practices were relevant, aligned with their objectives, rapidlyimplemented, and used novel strategies through new technologies. However, theseinitiatives had little intercultural relevance or evaluation. Perceived successwas related to motivation, leadership, and institutional and communityresilience. The adaptability of initiatives emerged as a new need and criterionof analysis. Conclusion The lessons learned from these initiatives invite us toconsider health care teams' mental health, their relationship with the community,the use of new technologies, the evaluation of practices consideringsatisfaction, cross- cutting approaches, and their adaptability. In all, theseaspects may improve primary care response in sexual and reproductive health tonew crises.

TI  - Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Learning Preferences and Perspectives ofGeneration Y and Z Students in Dental Education.
LID - 10.1111/idh.12602 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: For the first time in history, the COVID-19 pandemic requiredstudents at The University of Texas School of Dentistry (UTSD) to move to remote education. Based on a literature review, it was assumed that younger generations of students would prefer virtual teaching models over in-classroom formats. Thepurpose of this study is to assess students' perspectives of remote learningduring COVID-19 in dental education relative to their generation and program.METHODS: An electronic survey was administered to all UTSD dental and dentalhygiene students via Qualtrics. The survey collected information on demographics,pre-pandemic learning preferences, remote learning experiences during thepandemic, and a free response section. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze data. RESULTS: The survey received a 60% response rate (n=290). Over 95% of respondents belonged to Generations Y and Z. There were nosignificant differences in responses between generations. However, significantdifferences in responses between programs arose with more dental hygiene studentsagreed that they liked learning in a classroom setting compared to dentalstudents (p<0.01). Significantly more dental students agreed that they stayedorganized, were less stressed, and felt that the transition to online learningwas easy compared to dental hygiene students (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Although themajority of students surveyed belong to Generations Y and Z, there are stillpreferences for traditional, in-person learning. Both cohorts recognized thebenefits and challenges of distance learning and the findings from this studyshed light on how students are handling remote learning in dental education.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus (SARS, COVID-19) has been declareda pandemic by the World Health Organization since March 2020. Patients withactive cancer should be considered especially for priority access to the COVID-19vaccine. Therefore, our study aimed to learn parents' opinions ofcancer-diagnosed patients about the COVID-19 vaccine. Between December 2021 andJanuary 2022, 76 people were willing to answer the questionnaire from the parentsof outpatient/inpatient patients at the Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Clinic of Dr. Sami Ulus Obstetrics, Child Health and Diseases Education ResearchHospital were included. In our study, 18 parents (23.7%) did not get vaccinated. Among the reasons for not getting vaccinated, the most common answer for "I fear from the vaccine's side effects.", "Do you think oncology patients are at riskfor COVID-19?", "Do you think the COVID-19 pandemic affects cancer treatment?"were 90.7%, 89.5% and 21% yes, respectively. Would your opinion of the vaccine bepositive if the domestic vaccine was produced?"-67.4% answered yes. Vaccinehesitation and public misinformation put cancer patients at risk. Increasingawareness of the rejection of COVID-19 vaccines is important for public healthand the fight against the pandemic. In addition, the doctors' recommendations forconducting oncology treatment will significantly impact parents' compliance with the COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - Importance: Despite longstanding efforts to improve health care quality forpatients with complex needs who are at highest risk for hospitalization or death,to our knowledge, no guidance exists on what constitutes measurable high-quality care for this heterogeneous population. Identifying quality measures that arecross-cutting (ie, relevant to multiple chronic conditions and disease states)may enable health care professionals and health care systems to better design andreport on quality improvement efforts for this patient population. Objective: To identify quality measures of care and prioritize quality-of-care concepts in the ambulatory primary care setting for patients in the Veterans HealthAdministration (VHA) who have complex care needs and are at high risk for adverseoutcomes, such as hospitalization or death. Evidence Review: In this expert panelassessment and prioritization, relevant measure concepts for future qualitymeasure development in 3 care categories (assessment, management, and otherfeatures of health care) were extracted from a systematic review, conducted from June 2020 to June 2021, of published studies that suggested, evaluated, or usedindicators of quality care for patients at high risk of adverse outcomes. Measureconcepts associated with single conditions, surgical or other specialty caresettings, and inpatient care were excluded. A panel of 14 experts (10 VHA leadersand staff, 2 non-VHA physician investigators, and 2 veterans) discussed and ratedthe importance of the remaining set of potentially relevant measure conceptsusing a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method on January 15, 2021. Measureconcepts were rated on a scale of 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest priority. Amedian rating of 7.5 or greater was used as the cutoff to identify thehighest-priority items. Findings: The systematic review identified 519 measureconcepts, from which 15 domains and 49 measure concepts were proposed for expert panel consideration. After panel discussions and changes to measure concepts, theexpert panel rated 63 measure concepts in 13 domains. The measure concepts withthe highest median ratings focused on caregiver availability and support,COVID-19 vaccination, and pneumonia vaccination (all rated 9.0); housinginstability (rated 8.5); and physical function, depression symptoms, cognitiveimpairment, prescription regimen, primary care follow-up after an emergencydepartment visit or hospitalization, and timely transmission of dischargeinformation to primary care (all rated 8.0). Recommendations to improve careincluded timely assessment of housing instability, caregiver support, physicalfunction, depression symptoms, and cognitive impairment; annual prescriptionregimen review; coordinated transitions in care; and preventive care includingvaccinations. Conclusions and Relevance: The expert panelists identified aparsimonious set of high-priority, evidence-based, cross-cutting quality measure concepts for improving care of patients at high risk for adverse health outcomes in the VHA. These quality measures may inform both future research for patientsat high risk and health care system quality improvement.

TI  - Association of Receiving a Fourth Dose of the BNT162b Vaccine With SARS-CoV-2Infection Among Health Care Workers in Israel.
PG  - e2224657
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.24657 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Despite the high 3-dose vaccination rate among health care workers(HCWs) in Israel, a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in this groupwas observed during the Omicron wave. As a result, the Israeli Ministry of Healthdecided to recommend a fourth vaccine dose to medical staff. Objective: Toevaluate the benefit of a fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose on the breakthroughinfection rate among HCWs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicentercohort study was performed in January 2022, the first month of the 4-dosevaccination campaign, during a surge of the Omicron variant wave. All health careworkers at 11 general hospitals in Israel who had been vaccinated with 3 doses upto September 30, 2021, and had not contracted COVID-19 before the vaccinationcampaign were included. Exposures: Vaccination with a fourth dose of the BNT162b2vaccine during January 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Breakthrough COVID-19infections in 4-dose recipients vs 3-dose recipients measured by a polymerasechain reaction test result positive for SARS-CoV-2. Health care workers weretested based on symptoms or exposure. Results: A total of 29611 Israeli HCWs(19381 [65%] female; mean [SD] age, 44 [12] years) had received 3 vaccine dosesbetween August and September 2021; of these, 5331 (18%) received the fourth dose in January 2022 and were not infected by the first week after vaccination.Overall breakthrough infection rates were 368 of 5331 (7%) in the 4-dose groupand 4802 of 24280 (20%) in the 3-dose group (relative risk, 0.35; 95% CI,0.32-0.39). Similar reductions were found in a matched analysis by the exact day of receiving the third vaccine (relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.71) and in a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression model (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.50-0.63). In both groups, no severe disease or death occurred.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, the fourth BNT162b2 vaccine doseresulted in a reduced breakthrough infection rate among hospital staff. Thisreduction was lower than that observed after the third dose; nevertheless,considering the high infectivity of the Omicron variant, which led to criticalmedical staff shortages, a fourth vaccine dose should be considered to mitigatethe infection rate among HCWs.

TI  - Comparison of Use of Neoadjuvant Systemic Treatment for Breast Cancer andShort-term Outcomes Before vs During the COVID-19 Era in Ontario, Canada.
PG  - e2225118
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25118 [doi]
AB  - Importance: In response to an increase in COVID-19 infection rates in Ontario,several systemic treatment (ST) regimens delivered in the adjuvant setting forbreast cancer were temporarily permitted for neoadjuvant-intent to defernonurgent breast cancer surgical procedures. Objective: To examine the use andcompare short-term outcomes of neoadjuvant-intent vs adjuvant ST in the COVID-19 era compared with the pre-COVID-19 era. Design, Setting, and Participants: Thiswas a retrospective population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada. Patientswith cancer starting selected ST regimens in the COVID-19 era (March 11, 2020, toSeptember 30, 2020) were compared to those in the pre-COVID-19 era (March 11,2019, to March 10, 2020). Patients were diagnosed with breast cancer within 6months of starting systemic therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimates werecalculated for the use of neoadjuvant vs adjuvant ST, the likelihood of receivinga surgical procedure, the rate of emergency department visits, hospitaladmissions, COVID-19 infections, and all-cause mortality between treatment groupsover time. Results: Among a total of 10920 patients included, 7990 (73.2%)started treatment in the pre-COVID-19 era and 7344 (67.3%) received adjuvant ST; the mean (SD) age was 61.6 (13.1) years. Neoadjuvant-intent ST was more common inthe COVID-19 era (1404 of 2930 patients [47.9%]) than the pre-COVID-19 era (2172 of 7990 patients [27.2%]), with an odds ratio of 2.46 (95% CI, 2.26-2.69; P <.001). This trend was consistent across a range of ST regimens, but differedaccording to patient age and geography. The likelihood of receiving surgeryfollowing neoadjuvant-intent chemotherapy was similar in the COVID-19 eracompared with the pre-COVID-19 era (log-rank P = .06). However, patients withbreast cancer receiving neoadjuvant-intent hormonal therapy were significantlymore likely to receive surgery in the COVID-19 era (log-rank P < .001). Afteradjustment, there were no significant changes in the rate of emergency departmentvisits over time between patients receiving neoadjuvant ST, adjuvant ST, or STonly during the ST treatment period or postoperative period. Hospital admissions decreased in the COVID-19 era for patients who received neoadjuvant ST comparedwith adjuvant ST or ST alone (P for interaction = .01 for both) in eithersetting. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients were morelikely to start neoadjuvant ST in the COVID-19 era, which varied across theprovince and by indication. There was limited evidence to suggest any substantialimpact on short-term outcomes.

TI  - Rapid and quantitative detection of multiple antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 mutantproteins by photo-immobilized microarray.
LID - 10.1007/s44211-022-00161-z [doi]
AB  - A rapid automatic quantitative diagnostic system for multiple SARS-CoV-2 mutantprotein-specific antibodies was developed using a microarray with photoreactivepolymers. Two types of photoreactive polymers, phenylazide and polyoxyethylene,were prepared. The polymers were coated on a plastic plate. Aqueous solutions of mutant virus proteins were microspotted on the coated plate and immobilized byphotoirradiation. Virus-specific IgG in the serum or blood was automaticallyassayed using an instrument that we developed for pipetting, reagent stirring,and washing. The results highly correlated with those of the conventionalenzyme-linked immunoassay or immunochromatography. This system was successfullyused to test the sera or blood from the patients recovered from the infection andthe vaccinated individuals. The recovered individuals had antibodies against the nucleoprotein, in contrast to the vaccinated individuals. The amount ofantibodies produced decreased with an increase in virus mutation. Blood collectedfrom the fingertip (5 muL) and a test period of 8 min were sufficient conditions for conducting multiple antibody assays. We believe that our system wouldfacilitate rapid and quantitative automatic assays and aid in the diagnosis ofvarious viral infectious diseases and assessment of the immune status forclinical applications.

LID - 10.1007/s12640-022-00542-2 [doi]
AB  - Since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, the search for new approaches to treat this disease took place in the scientific community. The insilico approach has gained importance at this moment, once the methodologies usedin this kind of study allow for the identification of specific protein-ligandinteractions, which may serve as a filter step for molecules that can act asspecific inhibitors. In addition, it is a low-cost and high-speed technology.Molecular docking has been widely used to find potential viral protein inhibitorsfor structural and non-structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, aiming to block theinfection and the virus multiplication. The papain-like protease (PLpro)participates in the proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV-2 and composes one of the main targets studied for pharmacological intervention by in silico methodologies.Based on that, we performed a systematic review about PLpro inhibitors from theperspective of in silico research, including possible therapeutic molecules inrelation to this viral protein. The neurological problems triggered by COVID-19were also briefly discussed, especially relative to the similarities ofneuroinflammation present in Alzheimer's disease. In this context, we focused on two molecules, curcumin and glycyrrhizinic acid, given their PLpro inhibitoryactions and neuroprotective properties and potential therapeutic effects onCOVID-19.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): empiricalevidence for green economic implications.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22221-7 [doi]
AB  - Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China have been hit hard by thecoronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which has jeopardized their going out ofbusiness altogether. As a result, this research will shed light on the long-term impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on small businesses worldwide. The information wasgathered through a survey questionnaire that 313 people completed. Analyzing the model was accomplished through the use of SEM in this investigation. Managementand staff at SMEs worldwide provided the study's data sources. Research showsthat COVID-19 has a significantly bad influence on profitability, operational,economic, and access to finance. In the study's findings, outside funding aidshave played an important role in SMEs' skill to persist and succeed throughtechnological novelty than in their real output. SME businesses, administrations,and policymakers need to understand the implications of this study's results.

TI  - An Economic Evaluation of Government-Funded COVID-19 Testing in Australia.
LID - 10.1007/s40258-022-00749-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Easy and equitable access to testing has been a cornerstone of thepublic health response to COVID-19. Currently in Australia, testing usingpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for COVID-19 is free to the user, butgovernment funding for rapid antigen tests (RATs) is limited. We conduct aneconomic analysis of alternative government policies regarding the funding ofCOVID-19 testing in Australia. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed todescribe COVID-19 testing pathways for the Australian population over a 1-weekperiod. The model outputs were analysed to estimate R numbers associated withalternative funding policies, which were used to estimate COVID-19 cases over a6-month time horizon. Healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)effects were applied to new COVID-19 cases. The model was populated usingresponses to a de novo population survey and published data sources. RESULTS:Compared with no government-funded COVID-19 testing, government-funded testing isestimated to generate large incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs), up to A$15billion in the base-case analyses. Government-funded PCR testing and RATs for allis predicted to maximise INMBs in most tested scenarios, though funding RATs for all and not PCR tests has similar INMBs in many scenarios and generates higherbenefits to costs ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Our interpretation of the modelledanalysis is that at the time of writing (July 2022), with high vaccination uptakein Australia and few other public health measures in place, Australiangovernments should consider reducing funding of PCR testing, for example,limiting capacity to essential workers and individuals with known risk factorsfor serious symptoms, and fund RATs for all.

TI  - Epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment modalities of facial nerve palsyin COVID-19 patients: a systematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s13760-022-02026-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for a wide varietyof multi-system clinical features. Facial nerve palsy (FNP) is identified as one of the neurological complications of the virus. This work aims to systematically review the clinical picture, laboratory/imaging findings, treatment options, and prognostic factors of FNP in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Using six onlinedatabases, a search was conducted to include all articles with patients infected with COVID-19 and presenting with unilateral or bilateral FNP. Screening foreligibility and data extraction were done by three and four independentreviewers, respectively. Descriptive analyses and data visualizations were doneusing Google Sheets. Survival analysis and Kaplan-Meier plotting were done by Rsoftware. RESULTS: The data from 22 studies included 32 patients who wereinfected with COVID-19 and presented with clinical features of FNP. Fourteenpatients were male while 18 were female. FNP affected 29 patients unilaterallyand 3 patients bilaterally. The imaging findings confirmed that complications of FNP were COVID-19 related. Additionally, antivirals combined with steroids hadthe lowest median time (21, IQR = 8) to clinical improvement compared tosteroid-only (30, IQR = 15) and antiviral-only (33, IQR = 3.5) treatments.CONCLUSION: This study has shown a potential correlation between the increasedincidence of FNP and COVID-19. We have also found that combining antivirals with steroids may have better outcomes in patients with FNP and COVID-19 although the evidence to support this claim is not strong enough. Further studies are requiredto assess the extent of linkage between the two conditions and how to properlymanage FNP when encountered in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Reducing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19: a model simulation focused onQALYs, hospitalisation, productivity costs and optimal (soft) lockdown.
LID - 10.1007/s10198-022-01500-7 [doi]
AB  - Even if public health interventions are successful at reducing the spread ofCOVID-19, there is no guarantee that they will bring net benefits to the society because of the dynamic nature of the pandemic, e.g., the risk of a secondoutbreak if those interventions are stopped too early, and the costs of acontinued lockdown. In this analysis, a discrete-time dynamic model is used tosimulate the effect of reducing the effective reproduction number, driven bylockdowns ordered in March 2020 in four European countries (UK, France, Italy andSpain), on QALYs and hospitalisation costs. These benefits are valued in monetaryterms (euro30,000 per QALY assumed) and compared to productivity costs due toreduced economic activity during the lockdown. An analysis of the optimalduration of lockdown is performed where a net benefit is maximised. The switch toa soft lockdown is analysed and compared to a continued lockdown or nointervention. Results vary for two assumptions about hospital capacity of thehealth system: (a) under unlimited capacity, average benefit ranges from 8.21 to 14.21% of annual GDP, for UK and Spain, respectively; (b) under limited capacity,average benefits are higher than 30.32% of annual GDP in all countries. Thesimulation results imply that the benefits of lockdown are not substantial unlesscontinued until vaccination of high-risk groups is complete. It is illustratedthat lockdown may not bring net benefits under some scenarios and a soft lockdownwill be a more efficient alternative from mid-June 2020 only if the basicreproduction number is maintained low (not necessarily below 1) and productivity costs are sufficiently reduced.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on HIV Healthcare Service Engagement, TreatmentAdherence, and Viral Suppression in the United States: A Systematic LiteratureReview.
LID - 10.1007/s10461-022-03771-w [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated adaptations in how healthcare services arerendered. However, it is unclear how these adaptations have impacted HIVhealthcare services across the United States. We conducted a systematic review toassess the impacts of the pandemic on service engagement, treatment adherence,and viral suppression. We identified 26 total studies spanning the beginning ofthe pandemic (March 11, 2020) up until November 5, 2021. Studies were conductedat the national, state, and city levels and included representation from all fourCDC HIV surveillance regions. Studies revealed varying impacts of the pandemic onHIV healthcare retention/engagement, medication adherence, and viral suppression rates, including decreases in HIV healthcare visits, provider cancellations, and inability to get prescription refills. Telehealth was critical to ensuringcontinued access to care and contributed to improved retention and engagement in some studies. Disparities existed in who had access to the resources needed fortelehealth, as well as among populations living with HIV whose care was impacted by the pandemic.

TI  - Cardiac Assessment in Children with MIS-C: Late Magnetic Resonance ImagingFeatures.
LID - 10.1007/s00246-022-02977-y [doi]
AB  - Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) is a new entity that emerges 2-4 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. MIS-C can affect all systems, themost severe of which is cardiac involvement. The duration of the cardiac symptomsis still uncertain and may be persistent or prolonged. The American College ofRheumatology Clinical Guidelines recommends cardiac magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) 2-6 months after the diagnosis of MIS-C in patients presenting withsignificant transient left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the acute phase ofillness (LV ejection fraction 50%) or persistent LV dysfunction. There are a few studies investigating cardiac MRI findings in MIS-C patients. In this study, weaimed to evaluate cardiac MRI findings, at the earliest 3 months after diagnosis,and compare these findings with the echocardiograms in children with MIS-C. Aretrospective study including 34 MIS-C patients was conducted at a tertiary-levelUniversity Hospital between June 2020 and July 2021. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria were used in the diagnosis of MIS-C. Cardiac MRI wasperformed at least 3 months after MIS-C diagnosis. The study included 17 (50%)boys and 17 (50%) girls with a mean age of 9.31 +/- 4.72 years. Initialechocardiographic evaluation revealed cardiac abnormality in 13 (38.2) patients; 4 (11.8%) pericardial effusion, 4 (11.8%) left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) < 55%, and 5 (14.7%) coronary artery dilatation. Echocardiography showednormal LV systolic function in all patients during follow-up; coronary dilatationpersisted in 2 of 5 (40%) patients at the 6th-month visit. Cardiac MRI wasperformed in 31 (91.2%) patients, and myocardial hyperemia was not detected inany patients (T1 relaxation time was < 1044 ms in all children). However, 9 (29%)patients' MRI showed isolated elevated T2 levels, and 19 (61.3%) revealed atleast one of the following findings: pericardial effusion, right ventriculardysfunction, or LVEF abnormality. In patients with MIS-C, a high rate of cardiac involvement, particularly pericardial effusion was determined by cardiac MRIperformed at the earliest 2-6 months after diagnosis. Even if echocardiographydoes not reveal any abnormality in the initial phase, cardiac MRI should besuggested in MIS-C patients in the late period. This is the first study reportingcardiac MRI findings in the late period of MIS-C patients.

TI  - COVID Collaborations: A Physician Assistant Program and Health DepartmentPartnership.
LID - 10.1097/JPA.0000000000000438 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the displacement ofclinical-phase medical learners across the country. Physician assistant (PA) and other health professions programs were challenged to innovate and offer alternatelearning experiences that would meet students' needs as future health careprofessionals. At the same time, local and state health departments were facedwith quickly increasing their capacity for contact tracing and case investigationin response to the growing number of COVID-19 infections. Through a collaborativepartnership based on the needs of the local health department and clinical-phase PA students, the Duke PA program developed an elective in which students servedas contact tracers and case investigators. PA students provided over 1500 hoursof contact tracing and case investigation support to the local health department.Qualitative review showed students gained a greater appreciation of the impact ofsocial determinants of health, saw first-hand how the pandemic disproportionatelyaffected communities of color, and increased their knowledge about the role ofpublic health. The partnership between the PA program and the health departmentwas mutually beneficial and established a foundation for future collaborativeexperiences that support both the community and the needs of health professions' learners.

AB  - The COVID-19 Healthcare Coalition was established as a private sector-ledresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its purpose was to bring together healthcareorganizations, technology firms, nonprofits, academia, and startups to preservethe healthcare delivery system and help protect U.S. populations by providingdata-driven, real-time insights that improve outcomes. This required thecoalition to obtain, align, and orchestrate many heterogeneous data sources andpresent this data on dashboards in a format that was understandable and useful todecision makers. To do this, the coalition employed an ensemble approach toanalysis, combining machine learning algorithms together with theory-basedsimulations, allowing prognosis to provide computational decision support rooted in science and engineering.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are detected in approximately a quarterof COVID-19 patients when assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Since there isno information, our study investigated the presence of ANA detected byEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and its clinical and laboratoryassociations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted on 92patients with severe COVID-19, 20 patients with acute myocardial infarction, and 25 healthy subjects. Blood samples were obtained at hospital admission.Commercial ELISA was used to detect ANA, while flow cytometry was used to measureserum interferons. RESULTS: ANAs were positive in 8.6% of COVID-19 patients, 10% of myocardial infarction patients, and 4% in healthy individuals (p=0.676).COVID-19 patients with ANA+ had less ferritin, troponin, and neutrophils but morealbumin and lymphocytes than ANA- patients. Serum levels of type I, II, and IIIinterferons were similar between groups. At follow-up, all ANA+ patientssurvived, while mortality was significant in ANA- patients (0 vs. 36%; p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: ANA detection is not increased in severe cases of COVID-19 whenassessed by ELISA. However, its presence appears to be associated with a lessaggressive disease phenotype, regardless of circulating levels of interferons.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into the different protective mechanisms of approvedvaccines, this study focuses on the comparison of humoral and cellular immuneresponses of five widely used vaccines including ChAdOx1 (AZD1222, AstraZeneca), BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), and Gam-COVID-Vac(Sputnik V). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolated plasma from 95 volunteers' bloodsamples was used to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular immuneresponses. Positive controls were recovered patients from COVID-19(unvaccinated). Specific quantification kits for anti-nucleocapsid IgG,anti-Spike protein IgG, neutralizing antibodies as well as specific SARS-CoV-2antigens for T-cell activation were used and Spearman correlation and matrixanalyses were performed to compare overall immune responses. RESULTS:Nucleocapsid antibodies were significantly higher for the BBIBP-CorV andconvalescent group when compared to other vaccines. In contrast, subjectsvaccinated with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 presented significantly higher anti-spike IgG. In fact, 9.1% of convalescent, 4.5% of Gam-COVID-Vac, 28.6% of ChAdOx1, and 12.5% of BBIBP-CorV volunteers did not generate anti-spike IgG. Similarly, apositive correlation was observed after the neutralization assay. T-cellactivation studies showed that mRNA-based vaccines induced a T-cell driven immuneresponse in all cases, while 55% of convalescents, 8% of BNT162b1, 12,5% ofmRNA-1273, 9% of Gam-COVID-Vac, 57% of ChAdOx1, and 56% of BBIBP-CorV subjectspresented no cellular response. Further correlation matrix analyses indicatedthat anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies production, and T-cell activationfollow the same trend after immunization. CONCLUSIONS: RNA-based vaccines inducedthe most robust adaptive immune activation against SARS-CoV-2 by promoting asignificantly higher T-cell response, anti-spike IgG and neutralization levels.Vector-based vaccines protected against the virus at a comparable level toconvalescent patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory lungdisease that has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. It's an acute diffusive lung injury caused by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the lungs.Specific microRNAs have been identified to play a crucial role in therenin-angiotensin system signaling pathways the main pathophysiological pathwayresponsible for ARDS. Since the ARDS life-threatening complication associatedwith COVID-19 is an ongoing challenge, this current study aimed to investigatethe potential efficacy of xanthenone in the treatment of ARDS induced with LPS inmice through ACE2 activation and modulation of miR-200 and ACE2/Ang 1-7 pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were categorized into three groups randomly. Thefirst set of mice served as the normal control group. The ARDS group was injectedwith LPS (15 mg/kg; i.p.). The last group was treated with xanthenone (2mg/kg/day; p.o.) for one week before the LPS injection. RESULTS: Xanthenonetreatment resulted in a significant down-regulation of miRNA-200 expression,leading to the activation of ACE2 accompanied with marked inhibition ofAngiotensin II as well as increases the levels of Ang 1-7 and SP-A. CONCLUSIONS: Xanthenone has the potential to be a promising therapeutic drug for the treatmentof ARDS COVID-19 complication through activation of ACE2/Ang 1-7 pathways.Graphical Abstract:https://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Graphical_abstract.tif.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic broke out,caused by the coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reinfections can be observed with various respiratory viruses,including human coronaviruses. Moreover, they may result from weak or waninginitial immune response, reinfection with another genotype/subtype, or the rapid antigenic changes in the virus. The aim of this study was to investigate thelikelihood of reinfection in COVID-19 patients that had a positive qPCR testresult at least 60 days after a negative test result in patients that wereconfirmed with COVID-19 on qPCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results of a total of 105,000 samples that hadbeen obtained between April 1, 2020, and February 1, 2021, in two separateauthorized laboratories were retrospectively analyzed. 22 samples from 11patients included in the study, qPCR tests were repeated for each sample usingthe Rotorgene Q PCR system with Diagnovital SARS-CoV-2 (RTA Labs, Turkey)Real-Time PCR kits. Positive samples were screened for B.1.1.7 and E484Kmutations using the qPCR method on the Rotorgene Q PCR system with Bio-SpeedySARS-CoV-2 Variant Plus kits (Bioeksen Technology, Turkey). RESULTS: The 105,000 individuals comprised 55,614 men and 49,386 women. In the qPCR test, 14,511(13.82%) individuals were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 11(0.076%) patients were included in the study based on the inclusion criteria.Accordingly, the risk of reinfection was calculated as 0.076% (95% confidenceinterval [CI]: 0.056%-0.096%) and the incidence was 1.04 per 10,000 population(95% CI: 0.62-1.38 per 10,000). No patient was admitted to the intensive careunit or died during both episodes. Moreover, no B.1.1.7 or E484K mutation wasdetected in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of COVID-19 infectionposes serious risks for the development of new variants and the currently usedvaccines are likely to lose their efficacy against new variants. To reduce these risks and to be successful in the fight against the pandemic, we suggestcompliance with personal protective measures as well as rapid and widespreadapplication of vaccination not only in developed countries but also in the whole world and the modification of currently used vaccines in such a way to fightagainst newly emerged variants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors that mayaffect the prognosis and length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients,particularly immunoglobulin A. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients admitted to therelevant department or intensive care unit with a diagnosis of COVID-19 betweenApril 2020 and January 2021 were included in the study. Demographiccharacteristics of the patients and blood type, immunoglobulin A (IgA),C-reactive protein, D-dimer, procalcitonin, ferritin, troponin I, complete blood count, biochemical, and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerasechain reaction test results were evaluated retrospectively from the hospitalfiles and data system. RESULTS: A total of 164 COVID-19 patients were included inthis study. The median age was 72 (range: 30-95) years and the genderdistribution of women and men was 66/98 (40.2% vs. 59.8%, respectively). Therewas no statistically significant relationship between blood type andhospitalization time or mortality (p=0.497 and p=0.923, respectively). There was furthermore no statistically significant relationship between Rh group and theduration of hospitalization or prognosis (p=0.198 and p=0.827, respectively).There was no statistically significant correlation between IgA level andhospitalization time or prognosis (p=0.066, r=0.144). In the analysis of defined risk factors independently associated with death, the following were found to be significant indicators of mortality: leukopenia [beta: -2.973, OR (95% CI): 0.051(0.003-0.891), p=0.041], glucose [beta: 0.014, OR (95% CI): 1.014 (1.001-1.028), p=0.037], D-dimer [beta: 0.001, OR (95% CI): 1.001 (1.000-1.001), p=0.023],duration of hospitalization [beta: -0.218, OR (95% CI): 0.804 (0.708-0.913),p=0.001], and duration of stay in the intensive care unit [beta: 0.348, OR (95%CI): 1.416 (1.186-1.690), p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, no relationshipwas found between IgA level and hospitalization time or mortality among COVID-19 patients. However, leukopenia and increased glucose, D-dimer, neutrophil count,urea, and durations of hospital and intensive care stays were found to beimportant predictors of mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This report describes an ocular allergic reaction manifested as eyelidedema after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 28-year-oldfemale had the first Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine dose and was dischargedfollowing a 20-minute post-vaccination observation for potential adversecomplications. She came to the emergency department after her left eyelid swelledunexpectedly two hours later, accompanied by itching and redness. Aside from lefteyelid edema and redness, there were no other remarkable bilateral ocularfindings. The lack of recent history of any cause of eyelid edema suggested avaccine-induced ocular allergy. Immediate administration of systemic and topical anti-allergic medications resulted in a significant clinical improvement within4-6 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting any adverse reactions to vaccines, especiallyrecently approved ones, is extremely critical. Local ocular allergy, as opposedto systemic allergy, could be considered one of the COVID 19 vaccine's rare andmild side effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vaccination is an important method for preventing COVID-19 infection. However, certain vaccines do not meet the current needs. To improve the vaccineeffect, discard ineffective antigens, and focus on high-quality antigenicclusters, S1-E bivalent antigens were designed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vaccinedelivery is performed using poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Here, therecombinant S1-E (rS1-E) was covered on PLGA and injected intramuscularly intomice. In total, 48 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups with 8 mice in each group. The mice received intramuscular injections. Prior to vaccination, the hydrophobicity of the rS1-E and the antigenic site of the E protein were bothanalysed. The morphology, zeta potential, and particle size distribution ofrS1-E-PLGA were examined. Anti-S1 and anti-E antibodies were detected in mouseserum by ELISA. Neutralising an-tibodies were detected by co-incubating thepseudovirus with the obtained serum. IL-2 and TNF-alpha levels were alsomeasured. RESULTS: The designed recombinant S1-E protein was successfully coated on PLGA nanoparticles. rS1-E-PLGA nanovaccine has suitable size, shape, goodstability, sustained release and other characteristics. Importantly, mice werestimulated with rS1-E-PLGA nanovaccines to produce high-titre antibodies and agood cellular immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that rS1-E-PLGA nanovaccine may provide a good protective effect, and the vaccine should befurther investigated in human clinical trials for use in vaccination or as abooster.

TI  - Outcomes of Reamed Intramedullary Nailing for Lower Extremity DiaphysealFractures in COVID Positive Patients: A Multi-institutional Observational Study.
LID - 10.1097/BOT.0000000000002468 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if reamed intramedullary nailing(IMN) of tibial andfemoral shaft fractures exacerbated the hypercoagulable state of COVID infection,resulting in increased thromboembolic and pulmonary complications. DESIGN:Retrospective chart review. SETTING: 11 level I trauma centers. PATIENTS: FromJanuary 1st 2020 to December 1st, 2022 of 163 patients with orthopaedic traumaand COVID positivity, 36 patients with tibial and femoral shaft fractures wereincluded. INTERVENTION: Reamed IMN. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Incidence ofpost-operative thromboembolic and respiratory complications. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with a median age of 52 (range 18-92, IQR 29-72) met criteria. Therewere 21 and 15 patients with femoral and tibial shaft fractures. There were 15patients sustaining polytrauma, of which 10 had an NISS score > 17. All patients underwent reamed IMN in a median of 1 day (range 0-12 d, IQR=1-2) post-injury.Two patients developed ARDS and 3 pneumonia (PNA). No patients had pulmonaryembolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or died within 30 days. CONCLUSION: Inthis multi-institutional review of COVID positive patients undergoing reamed IMN,there were no thromboembolic events. All patients developing pulmonarycomplications (ARDS or PNA) had baseline COPD, were immune-compromised, orsustained polytraumatic injuries with NISS > 20. Given this, it appearsreasonable to continue using reamed IMN for tibial and femoral shaft fracturesafter evaluation of COVID severity, comorbidities, and other injuries. LEVEL OFEVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a completedescription of levels of evidence.

AB  - Spike (S) glycoproteins is the most significant structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a key target for neutralizing antibodies. In light of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, identification and screening of epitopes of spike glycoproteins willprovide vital progress in the development of sensitive and specific diagnostictools. In the present study, NTD, RBD and S2 gene were inserted to thepcDNA3.1(+) vector and designed with N-terminal 6xHis-tag for fusion expressionin HEK293F cells by transient transfection. Six monoclonal antibodies (4G, 9E,4B, 7D, 8F, 3D) were prepared using the expressed proteins by cell fusiontechnique. The characterization of mAbs were performed by indirect -ELISA,western blot and IFA. We designed 49 overlapping synthetized peptides cover theextracellular region of S protein which 6 amino acid residues were offset betweenadjacent (S1-S49). Peptides S12, S19 and S49 were identified as theimmunodominant epitopes regions by the mAbs. These regions were further truncatedand the peptides S12.2 (286)TDAVDCALDPLS(297), S19.2 (464)FERDISTEIYQA(475) andS49.4 (1202)ELGKYEQYIKWP(1213) were identified as B- cell linear epitopes for thefirst time. Alanine scans showed that, the (D)467, (I)468, (E)471, (Q)474, (A)475of the epitope S19.2 and (K)1205, (Q)1208, (Y)1209 of the epitope S49.4 were the core sites involved in the mAbs binding. Multiple sequence alignment analysisshowed that these three epitopes were highly conserved among the variants ofconcern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs). Taken together, the findingsprovide a potential material for rapid diagnosis methods of COVID-19.

TI  - Effects of natural RNA modifications on the activity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
LID - 10.1111/febs.16587 [doi]
AB  - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays the key role in replication of RNAviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Processive RNA synthesis by RdRp is crucial forsuccessful genome replication and expression, especially in the case of very longcoronaviral genomes. Here, we analyzed the activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (thensp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex) on synthetic primer-templates of various structures,including substrates with mismatched primers or template RNA modifications. Ithas been shown that RdRp cannot efficiently extend RNA primers containingmismatches and has no intrinsic RNA cleavage activity to remove the primer3'-end, thus necessitating the action of exoribonuclease for proofreading.Similarly to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RdRp can perform processivepyrophosphorolysis of the nascent RNA product but this reaction is also blockedin the presence of mismatches. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that naturalpost-transcriptional modifications in the RNA template that do not preventcomplementary interactions (N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, inosine andpseudouridine) do not change RdRp processivity. At the same time, certainmodifications of RNA bases and ribose residues strongly block RNA synthesis,either prior to nucleotide incorporation (3-methyluridine, 1-methylguanosine) or immediately after it (2'-O-methylation). The results demonstrate that theactivity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can be strongly inhibited by common modifications of the RNA template suggesting a way for design of novel antiviral compounds.

TI  - Harnessing the Electronic Health Care Record to Optimize Patient Safety inPrimary Care: Framework for Evaluating e-Safety-Netting Tools.
PG  - e35726
LID - 10.2196/35726 [doi]
AB  - The management of diagnostic uncertainty is part of every primary carephysician's role. e-Safety-netting tools help health care professionals to managediagnostic uncertainty. Using software in addition to verbal or paper basedsafety-netting methods could make diagnostic delays and errors less likely. Thereare an increasing number of software products that have been identified ase-safety-netting tools, particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.e-Safety-netting tools can have a variety of functions, such as sending clinicianalerts, facilitating administrative tasking, providing decision support, andsending reminder text messages to patients. However, these tools have not beenevaluated by using robust research designs for patient safety interventions. Wepresent an emergent framework of criteria for effective e-safety-netting toolsthat can be used to support the development of software. The framework is basedon validated frameworks for electronic health record development and patientsafety. There are currently no tools available that meet all of the criteria inthe framework. We hope that the framework will stimulate clinical and publicconversations about e-safety-netting tools. In the future, a validated framework would drive audits and improvements. We outline key areas for future researchboth in primary care and within integrated care systems.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Adoption of Voluntary Nonpharmaceutical Interventions to Control COVID-19 in Japan: Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e34268
LID - 10.2196/34268 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trust in government is seen to facilitate crisis management andpolicy instrument adoption across numerous studies. However, in Japan, publicsupport for government handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and trust in thegovernment is low, yet the adoption of voluntary nondigital nonpharmaceuticalinterventions (NPIs) is high. This is an important tension this study seeks tounravel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the antecedents ofnondigital NPI and tracking app adoption in the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.METHODS: A commercial company was contracted to deliver an online survey of 1248 Japanese citizens in December 2020. A quota technique was used to deliver asample representative in terms of gender, age, residence, income, and education. RESULTS: The adoption of voluntary nondigital NPIs is predicted by confidence in public health scientists and a favoring of infection control over reducingeconomic and social costs. A novel and unexpected finding is that trust ingovernment does not predict nondigital NPI use. Perceived risk and knowledge ofinfection did not increase the use of nondigital NPIs. Education and income were not significant factors, although female and older respondents demonstratedgreater compliance. For the adoption of a phone tracking app, trust in governmentis important, as is urban residence, albeit with a lower use of the app compared to nondigital NPIs. CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary compliance in the adoption ofnondigital NPIs-if skillfully led by trusted scientific experts and in accordwith societal norms-can be effectively achieved. We provide evidence that trustin government is effective in encouraging the use of the Japanese tracking app.Moreover, the technical efficacy of digital initiatives and perceptions of suchwill unsurprisingly affect citizen support and use of digital tools.

TI  - A Biofeedback-Based Mobile App With Serious Games for Young Adults With Anxietyin the United Arab Emirates: Development and Usability Study.
PG  - e36936
LID - 10.2196/36936 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Following the outbreak of COVID-19, several studies have reportedthat young adults encountered a rise in anxiety symptoms, which could negatively affect their quality of life. Promising evidence suggests that mobile apps withbiofeedback, serious games, breathing exercises, and positive messaging, amongother features, are useful for anxiety self-management and treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate the usability of a biofeedback-based appwith serious games for young adults with anxiety in the United Arab Emirates(UAE). METHODS: This study consists of two phases: Phase I describes the designand development of the app, while Phase II presents the results of a usabilityevaluation by experts. To elicit the app's requirements during Phase I, weconducted (1) a survey to investigate preferences of young adults in the UAE for mobile games for stress relief; (2) an analysis of serious games for anxiety; and(3) interviews with mental health professionals and young adults in the UAE. InPhase II, five experts tested the usability of the developed app using a set ofNielsen's usability heuristics. RESULTS: A fully functional biofeedback-based appwith serious games was co-designed with mental health professionals. The appincluded 4 games (ie, a biofeedback game, card game, arcade game, and memorygame), 2 relaxation techniques (ie, a breathing exercise and yoga videos), and 2 additional features (ie, positive messaging and a mood tracking calendar). Theresults of Phase II showed that the developed app is efficient, simple, and easy to use. Overall, the app design scored an average of 4 out of 5. CONCLUSIONS: Theelicitation techniques used in Phase I resulted in the development of aneasy-to-use app for the self-management of anxiety. Further research is required to determine the app's usability and effectiveness in the target population.

TI  - Utilizing Real-time Technology to Assess the Impact of Home EnvironmentalExposures on Asthma Symptoms: Protocol for an Observational Pilot Study.
PG  - e39887
LID - 10.2196/39887 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is estimated that over 60% of adults with asthma have uncontrolledsymptoms, representing a substantial health and economic impact. The effects ofthe home environment and exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and fineparticulate matter (PM2.5) on adults with asthma remain unknown. In addition,methods currently used to assess the home environment do not capture real-timedata on potentially modifiable environmental exposures or their effect on asthma symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to (1) determine the feasibility and usability of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess self-reportresidential environmental exposures and asthma symptoms, home monitoring ofobjective environmental exposures (total VOCs and PM2.5), and lung function interms of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%); (2) assess the frequencyand level of residential environmental exposures (eg, disinfectants/cleaners,secondhand smoke) via self-reported data and home monitoring objective measures; (3) assess the level of asthma control as indicated by self-reported asthmasymptoms and lung function; and (4) explore associations of self-reported andobjective measures of residential environmental exposures with self-reported and objective measures of asthma control. METHODS: We will recruit 50 adults withasthma who have completed our online Global COVID-19 Asthma Study, indicatedwillingness to be contacted for future studies, reported high use ofdisinfectant/cleaning products, and have asthma that is not well controlled.Participants will receive an indoor air quality monitor and a home spirometer to measure VOCs, PM2.5, and FEV1%, respectively. EMA data will be collected using a personal smartphone and EMA software platform. Participants will be sentscheduled and random EMA notifications to assess asthma symptoms, environmentalexposures, lung function, and mitigation strategies. After the 14-day datacollection period, participants will respond to survey items related toacceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. RESULTS: This study was fundedin March 2021. We pilot tested our procedures and began recruitment in April2022. The anticipated completion of the study is 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Findings fromthis feasibility study will support a powered study to address the impact of homeenvironmental exposures on asthma symptoms and develop tailored, home-basedasthma interventions that are responsive to the changing home environment andhome routines.

TI  - Novel Spectrophotometric Approaches for the Simultaneous Quantification ofTernary Common Cold Mixture Containing Paracetamol with a Challenging FormulationRatio: Greenness Profile Evaluation.
LID - qsac031 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jaoacint/qsac031 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Common cold and cough preparations represent a huge segment of theglobal pharmaceutical market. Recently, cold/cough formulations containingparacetamol (PAR) have attracted significant attention as PAR has beenimplemented into the supportive treatment of mild cases of COVID-19 as thefirst-line antipyretic. From a literature review, no method has been reported yetfor simultaneous estimation of PAR, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (PSE) andcarbinoxamine maleate (CRX) in any matrix. Thus, there is an urgent need forsmart and green methods that would enable quantification of the cited components in their challenging ratio. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work is to develop andvalidate the first UV spectrophotometric methods for simultaneous determinationof the selected drugs taking into consideration the list of challenges including the highly overlapping features and spectral interferences in the cited mixture. METHODS: Namely, the proposed methods are: direct spectrophotometry, dualwavelength, first derivative, derivative ratio, ratio difference, constant centercoupled with spectrum subtraction, and the constant multiplication method paired with spectrum subtraction. RESULTS: These methods were linear over theconcentration range of 2.5-35 mug/mL, 1.5-20 mug/mL, and 4.5-35 mug/mL for PAR,PSE and CRX, respectively. These methods fulfill the validity parametersaccording to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Theresults obtained were statistically benchmarked to the official ones where nosignificant difference was noticed. CONCLUSION: The developed methods aresuccessfully applied for concurrent quantification of the studied components inthe marketed dosage form without interference from matrix excipients. The impact on the environment was assessed by five green metrics, namely a recent Analyticalgreenness (AGREE) metric algorithm based on the green analytical chemistryframework, Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI), Eco-Scale, Assessment ofGreen Profile (AGP), and National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI). HIGHLIGHTS:Eco-friendly and successive spectrophotometric methods were firstly developed in this work, for the simultaneous quantification of PAR, PSE and CRX. Theseapproaches incorporate a simple enrichment-aided technique to augment theirspectrophotometric signals, facilitating the accurate quantitation of the minorcomponent in the cited mixture.

TI  - Longitudinal assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness and body mass of younghealthy adults during COVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00253.2022 [doi]
AB  - Physical activity was reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially whenlockdowns were mandated; however, little is known about the impact of theselifestyle changes on objective measures of cardiorespiratory fitness. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated the cardiorespiratory fitness of 14 younghealthy adults (4 women, age: 27+/-6 yr) just prior to the pandemic and after ~1 year of public health measures being in place. During fitness assessments,participants performed submaximal pseudorandom cycling exercise to assesscardiorespiratory kinetics, and a 25 W.min(-1) ramp-incremental cycling test todetermine peak oxygen uptake (VO2). Cluster analysis identified two subgroups of participants: those who had reduced peak VO2 at the 1-year follow-up(-0.50+/-0.17 L.min(-1)) and those whose peak VO2 was maintained (0.00+/-0.10L.min(-1)). Participants with reduced peak VO2 also exhibited slower heart ratekinetics (interaction: p=0.01), reduced peak O2 pulse (interaction: p<0.001), andlower peak work rate (interaction: p<0.001) after 1 year of the pandemic, whereasthese variables were unchanged in the group of participants who maintained peakVO2. Regardless of changes in peak VO2, both subgroups of participants gainedbody mass (main effect: p=0.002), which was negatively correlated withparticipants' level of self-reported physical activity level at the follow-upassessment (mass: rho=-0.59, p=0.03) These findings suggest that some younghealthy individuals lost cardiorespiratory fitness during the pandemic, whileothers gained weight, but both changes could potentially increase the risk ofadverse health outcomes and disease later in life if left unaddressed.

AB  - While improving opioid safety has been a national priority, the coronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with increased rates ofopioid overdose. The present study characterized outpatient opioid and naloxoneprescribing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective chart reviewwas conducted of adult patients receiving opioid therapy between August 2020through October 2020 from outpatient clinics within a Texas health system. Theprimary outcome was naloxone co-prescription during the study period or withinthe year prior. During the study period, 1,368 patients received an opioidprescription, most of which were prescribed for chronic pain treatment (63.0%).Most opioid prescriptions (91.5%) were written for < 50 MME/day. Forprescriptions written for acute pain, 78% were written for </= 10 days supply.While 31.1% of patients received gabapentinoid prescriptions, few (7.9%) receivedbenzodiazepine or Z-hypnotic prescriptions. Twenty-two (1.6%) patients wereco-prescribed naloxone. In this study, naloxone was rarely prescribed foroutpatients receiving opioid prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthsystems should continue to prioritize adherence to evidence-based clinicalguidelines and increase access to naloxone.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of COVID-19 on individuals with tinnitusand their views to guide future tinnitus care. DESIGN: A mixed-methodscross-sectional research design. STUDY SAMPLE: An online survey was completed by 365 individuals with tinnitus from Australia and other countries. RESULTS:Tinnitus was reported to be more bothersome during the pandemic by 36% ofrespondents, whereas 59% reported no change and 5% reported less bothersometinnitus. Nearly half of the respondents had received COVID-19 vaccination(s) and12% of them reported more bothersome tinnitus while 2% developed tinnituspost-vaccination. Australian respondents spent less time in self-isolation orquarantine and saw fewer change in in-person social contact than respondents fromother countries. More than 70% of respondents thought that tinnitus care serviceswere insufficient both before and during the pandemic. Regarding their opinionson how to improve tinnitus care in the future, five themes including alleviation of condition, government policies, reduced barriers, self- and public-awareness, and hearing devices were identified. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of respondents didnot perceive any change in tinnitus perception and one-third of respondents hadworsened tinnitus during the pandemic. To improve tinnitus care, better awarenessand more accessible resources and management are crucial.

TI  - Legal Determinants of Health.
LID - fwac025 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/medlaw/fwac025 [doi]
AB  - Social determinants of health are the social and economic conditions that have a determining impact on health at an individual and population level. Workingwithin this framework, in 2019 the O'Neill Institute for National and GlobalHealth Law at Georgetown University and The Lancet published The legaldeterminants of health: Harnessing the power of law for global health andsustainable development. This report identifies and promotes four legaldeterminants: provision of universal health coverage under the SustainableDevelopment Goals; governance of national and global health institutions;implementation of evidence-based health interventions; and building legalcapacity. These determinants are dominated by the role of law in founding andgoverning health institutions and regulating their interventions. Such work isessential. However, the relationship between law, health improvement, and health equity articulated through these four determinants risks marginalising questions of disadvantage and inequality that social determinants of health research-andthe report itself-mandate we attend to. Addressing the UK experience of COVID-19,and how social inequalities profoundly impacted experiences and outcomes in thefirst year of the pandemic, this article builds on the Lancet-O'NeillCommission's important work to argue that any articulation of legal determinants of health must foreground law's role in improving fairness in social arrangementsand the distribution of resources.

PG  - 284-288
LID - 10.18071/isz.75.0284 [doi]
AB  - Scientific literature about the ongoing COVID-19 disease and pandemic isconsiderable, though articles concentrate on the severe cases and their centralnervous system manifestations. This article demonstrates two cases: middle-agedfemale patients who had serologically proven SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild upperairway and central nervous system symptoms. The patients reported vivid, strange,simple, and complex visual and auditory hallucinations. A characteristic element of these complex hallucinations was a talking human-shaped figure. Only threesimilar cases have been published; this article discusses common features of all five patients. This summary highlights that in COVID-19 cases, minor centralnervous system symptoms can accompany mild or even missing upper respiratorysymptoms. The cranial MRIs of the presented patients were normal, but the EEGshowed focal abnormalities in localizations related to hallucinations, whichemphasizes the importance of EEG in differential diagnostic procedures.

TI  - [Telecare in Parkinson's disease: A nationwide survey among Hungarianneurologists].
PG  - 265-273
LID - 10.18071/isz.75.0265 [doi]
AB  - Background and purpose: COVID-19 has made providing in-person care difficult. In most countries, including Hungary, telemedicine has partly served as a resolutionfor this issue. Our purpose was to explore the effects of COVID-19 onneurological care, the knowledge of neurology specialists on telemedicine, andthe present state of telecare in Hungary, with a special focus on Parkinson'sdisease (PD). Methods: Between July and October 2021, a nationwide online survey was conducted among actively practicing Hungarian neurology specialists who were managing patients with PD. Results: A total of 104 neurologists were surveyed.All levels of care were evaluated in both publicly funded and private healthcare.Both time weekly spent on outpatient specialty consultation and the number ofpatients with PD seen weekly significantly decreased in public healthcare, while remained almost unchanged in private care (p<0.001); higher portion of patientswere able to receive in-person care in private care (78.8% vs. 90.8%, p<0.001).In telecare, prescribing medicines has already been performed by the most (n=103,99%). Electronic messages were the most widely known telemedicine tools (n=98,94.2%), while phone call has already been used by most neurologists (n=95,91.3%). Video-based consultation has been more widely used in private than publiccare (30.1% vs. 15.5%, p=0.001). Teleprocedures were considered most suitable formonitoring progression and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and evaluating theneed for adjustments to antiparkinsonian pharmacotherapy. Conclusion: COVID-19has had a major impact on the care of patients with PD in Hungary. Telemedicinehas mitigated these detrimental effects; however, further developments could makeit an even more reliable component of care.

TI  - Evaluating and Improving Cancer Screening Process Quality in a MultilevelContext: The PROSPR II Consortium Design and Research Agenda.
PG  - 1521-1531
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-22-0100 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer screening is a complex process involving multiple steps andlevels of influence (e.g., patient, provider, facility, health care system,community, or neighborhood). We describe the design, methods, and research agendaof the Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process (PROSPR II)consortium. PROSPR II Research Centers (PRC), and the Coordinating Center aim to identify opportunities to improve screening processes and reduce disparitiesthrough investigation of factors affecting cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening in U.S. community health care settings. METHODS: We collectedmultilevel, longitudinal cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening process data from clinical and administrative sources on >9 million racially andethnically diverse individuals across 10 heterogeneous health care systems withcohorts beginning January 1, 2010. To facilitate comparisons across organ typesand highlight data breadth, we calculated frequencies of multilevelcharacteristics and volumes of screening and diagnostic tests/procedures andabnormalities. RESULTS: Variations in patient, provider, and facilitycharacteristics reflected the PROSPR II health care systems and differing target populations. PRCs identified incident diagnoses of invasive cancers, in situcancers, and precancers (invasive: 372 cervical, 24,131 colorectal, 11,205 lung; in situ: 911 colorectal, 32 lung; precancers: 13,838 cervical, 554,499colorectal). CONCLUSIONS: PROSPR II's research agenda aims to advance: (i)conceptualization and measurement of the cancer screening process, its multilevelfactors, and quality; (ii) knowledge of cancer disparities; and (iii) evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic's initial impacts on cancer screening. We inviteresearchers to collaborate with PROSPR II investigators. IMPACT: PROSPR II is avaluable data resource for cancer screening researchers.

AB  - PURPOSES: The aims of the study were to review 3 cases of lithium toxicity among individuals with bipolar disorder who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and to review the literature discussing the implications of COVID-19 and exposure to SARS-CoV-2relative to medical use of lithium in management of bipolar disorder. METHODS:This is a case review of medical and psychiatric notes of 3 individuals withbipolar disorder, managed with lithium, who developed COVID-19. This studydiscussed these cases in context of previous case reports and relevant literaturepertaining to lithium and exposure to SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: Infection withSARS-CoV-2 along with symptoms of COVID-19 and mental state changes in threeindividuals were temporally associated with lithium levels in the toxic range.IMPLICATIONS: Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 shouldresult in increased clinical monitoring of individuals taking lithium. Thosetaking lithium and providers are advised to have a low clinical threshold forrequesting lithium levels and kidney function estimates for the duration of theCOVD-19 pandemic.

TI  - Porcine Deltacoronavirus Infection Cleaves HDAC2 to Attenuate Its AntiviralActivity.
PG  - e0102722
LID - 10.1128/jvi.01027-22 [doi]
AB  - Protein acetylation plays an important role during virus infection. Thus, it isnot surprising that viruses always evolve elaborate mechanisms to regulate thefunctions of histone deacetylases (HDACs), the essential transcriptional andepigenetic regulators for deacetylation. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), anemerging enteropathogenic coronavirus, causes severe diarrhea in suckling pigletsand has the potential to infect humans. In this study, we found that PDCoVinfection inhibited cellular HDAC activity. By screening the expressions ofdifferent HDAC subfamilies after PDCoV infection, we unexpectedly found thatHDAC2 was cleaved. Ectopic expression of HDAC2 significantly inhibited PDCoVreplication, while the reverse effects could be observed after treatment with an HDAC2 inhibitor (CAY10683) or the knockdown of HDAC2 expression by specificsiRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PDCoV-encoded nonstructural protein 5(nsp5), a 3C-like protease, was responsible for HDAC2 cleavage through itsprotease activity. Detailed analyses showed that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved HDAC2 atglutamine 261 (Q261), and the cleaved fragments (amino acids 1 to 261 and 262 to 488) lost the ability to inhibit PDCoV replication. Interestingly, the Q261cleavage site is highly conserved in HDAC2 homologs from other mammalian species,and the nsp5s encoded by seven tested mammalian coronaviruses also cleaved HDAC2,suggesting that cleaving HDAC2 may be a common strategy used by differentmammalian coronaviruses to antagonize the antiviral role of HDAC2. IMPORTANCE As an emerging porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus that possesses the potential to infect humans, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is receiving increasingattention. In this work, we found that PDCoV infection downregulated cellularhistone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Of particular interest, the viral 3C-likeprotease, encoded by the PDCoV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), cleaved HDAC2, andthis cleavage could be observed in the context of PDCoV infection. Furthermore,the cleavage of HDAC2 appears to be a common strategy among mammaliancoronaviruses, including the emerging severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to antagonize the antiviral role of HDAC2. To ourknowledge, PDCoV nsp5 is the first identified viral protein that can cleavecellular HDAC2. Results from our study provide new targets to develop drugscombating coronavirus infection.

TI  - A Bispecific Antibody Targeting RBD and S2 Potently Neutralizes SARS-CoV-2Omicron and Other Variants of Concern.
PG  - e0077522
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00775-22 [doi]
AB  - Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)variants, especially the Omicron variant, have impaired the efficacy of existing vaccines and most therapeutic antibodies, highlighting the need for additionalantibody-based tools that can efficiently neutralize emerging SARS-CoV-2variants. The use of a "single" agent to simultaneously target multiple distinct epitopes on the spike is desirable in overcoming the neutralizing escape ofSARS-CoV-2 variants. Herein, we generated a human-derived IgG-like bispecificantibody (bsAb), Bi-Nab35B5-47D10, which successfully retained parentalspecificity and simultaneously bound to the two distinct epitopes onreceptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2. Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 showed improved spikebinding breadth among wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2, variants of concern (VOCs), and variants being monitored (VBMs) compared with its parental monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Furthermore, pseudotyped virus neutralization demonstrated thatBi-Nab35B5-47D10 can efficiently neutralize VBMs, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta(B.1.351), and Kappa (B.1.617.1), as well as VOCs, including Delta (B.1.617.2),Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2. Crucially, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 substantiallyimproved neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1 (IC50 = 0.15 nM) and Omicron BA.2 (IC50 = 0.67 nM) compared with its parental MAbs. Therefore,Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 represents a potential effective countermeasure againstSARS-CoV-2 Omicron and other variants of concern. IMPORTANCE The new, highlycontagious SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant caused substantial breakthrough infections and has become the dominant strain in countries across the world. Omicronvariants usually bear high mutations in the spike protein and exhibitconsiderable escape of most potent neutralization monoclonal antibodies andreduced efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines. The development of neutralizingantibodies with potent efficacy against the Omicron variant is still an urgentpriority. Here, we generated a bsAb, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10, which simultaneouslytargets SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S2 and improves the neutralizing potency and breadthagainst SARS-CoV-2 WT and the tested variants compared with their parentalantibodies. Notably, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 has more potent neutralizing activityagainst the VOC Omicron pseudotyped virus. Therefore, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 is afeasible and potentially effective strategy by which to treat and preventCOVID-19.

LID - 10.5935/1518-0557.20220019 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has emerged as the biggest pandemic of the world of all times. Its deathtoll is rising globally. COVID-19 mostly affects the lungs because the virusenters the host cells via the receptor for the ACE2 enzyme, which is also presentin other organs of the human body. ACE2 plays the main role in the degradation ofAng II, resulting in the formation of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) which maintainsthe level of Ang II. This communication gives an assessment of reproductivesystem functioning and its effects by the COVID-19 exposure. It is important tomaintain the wellbeing for healthy nourishment of the fetus and safe deliveryalong with post health issues. ACE2 enzyme metabolism is expressed in the female reproductive system, and it may be potential target of COVID-19 exposure.

TI  - Syringe Service Program Perspectives on Barriers, Readiness, and ProgrammaticNeeds to Support Rollout of the COVID-19 Vaccine.
LID - 10.1097/ADM.0000000000001036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored syringe service program (SSP) perspectives on barriers,readiness, and programmatic needs to support coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine uptake among people who use drugs. METHODS: We conducted an exploratoryqualitative study, leveraging an existing sample of SSPs in the United States.Semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted with SSP staff betweenFebruary and April 2021. Interviews were analyzed using a Rapid AssessmentProcess, an intensive, iterative process that allows for rapid analysis oftime-sensitive qualitative data. RESULTS: Twenty-seven SSPs completed aqualitative interview. Many SSP respondents discussed that COVID-19 vaccinationwas not a priority for their participants because of competing survivalpriorities, and respondents shared concerns that COVID-19 had deepenedparticipant mistrust of health care. Most SSPs wanted to participate in COVID-19 vaccination efforts; however, they identified needed resources, includingadequate space, personnel, and training, to implement successful vaccineprograms. CONCLUSIONS: Although SSPs are trusted resources for people who usedrugs, many require additional structural and personnel support to addressbarriers to COVID-19 vaccination among their participants. Funding and supportingSSPs in the provision of COVID-19 prevention education and direct vaccineservices should be a top public health priority.

TI  - Genomic epidemiology of the first two waves of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.73896 [doi]
LID - e73896 [pii]
AB  - Tracking the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages using phylogenetics has proven critical to inform the timing and stringency of COVID-19 public healthinterventions. We investigated the effectiveness of international travelrestrictions at reducing SARS-CoV-2 importations and transmission in Canada inthe first two waves of 2020 and early 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic treeswere used to infer viruses' geographic origins, enabling identification of 2263(95% confidence interval: 2159-2366) introductions, including 680 (658-703)Canadian sublineages, which are international introductions resulting in sampled Canadian descendants, and 1582 (1501-1663) singletons, introductions with nosampled descendants. Of the sublineages seeded during the first wave, 49%(46-52%) originated from the USA and were primarily introduced into Quebec (39%) and Ontario (36%), while in the second wave, the USA was still the predominantsource (43%), alongside a larger contribution from India (16%) and the UK (7%).Following implementation of restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals on 21 March 2020, importations declined from 58.5 (50.4-66.5) sublineages per week to10.3-fold (8.3-15.0) lower within 4 weeks. Despite the drastic reduction in viralimportations following travel restrictions, newly seeded sublineages in summerand fall 2020 contributed to the persistence of COVID-19 cases in the secondwave, highlighting the importance of sustained interventions to reducetransmission. Importations rebounded further in November, bringing newly emergentvariants of concern (VOCs). By the end of February 2021, there had been anestimated 30 (19-41) B.1.1.7 sublineages imported into Canada, which increasinglydisplaced previously circulating sublineages by the end of the secondwave.Although viral importations are nearly inevitable when global prevalence is high, with fewer importations there are fewer opportunities for novel variants tospark outbreaks or outcompete previously circulating lineages.

AB  - We aimed to determine if long-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrationsare associated with increased risk of testing positive for COVID-19 amongpregnant individuals who were universally screened at delivery and ifsocioeconomic status (SES) modifies this relationship. We used obstetric datafrom Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City fromMarch-December 2020, which included Medicaid use (low-SES surrogate) andcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test results. We linked 300m resolutionestimated 2018-2019 PM2.5 concentrations and census tract-level populationdensity, household size and income, and mobility estimates. Analyses included3318 individuals; 5% tested positive for COVID-19 at delivery, 8% tested positiveduring pregnancy, 48% used Medicaid, and average long-term PM2.5 concentrationswere 7.4 mug/m3 (SD = 0.8). In adjusted multilevel logistic regression models, wesaw no association between PM2.5 and ever-testing positive for COVID-19; however,odds were elevated among those using Medicaid (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0, 2.5 per 1-mug/m3 increase). Further, while only 22% of those testing positive showed symptoms, 69% of symptomatic individuals used Medicaid. SES, including unmeasuredoccupational exposures or increased susceptibility to the virus due to co-social and environmental exposures, may explain the increased odds of testing positivefor COVID-19 confined to vulnerable pregnant individuals using Medicaid.

TI  - A planned behavior theory-based explanatory model of protective behavior against COVID-19, with an age perspective.
PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1080/00224545.2022.2099241 [doi]
AB  - In this study, an explanatory model of protective behaviors against COVID-19transmission based on the theory of planned behavior is tested using a sample of 904 individuals by adding two relevant variables in the COVID-19 context:skepticism and responsibility toward COVID-19 transmission. Responsibility andthe intention to behave in a protective way act as mediators in predictingprotective behaviors. The model is invariant between younger and older people,although some path differences were found: the perception that individuals haveabout the extent to which their reference group adopts protective behaviorsdirectly influences individual protective behavior for younger but not olderpeople, for whom subjective social norms were only indirect predictors of suchbehavior. Additionally, the rates in all the variables showed that the groupunder 35 took more risks in the context of protective behaviors against COVID-19:they exhibited more skepticism, lower behavioral control, perceived fewerpositive social norms regarding protective behaviors, felt less responsible forspreading the disease, had less intention to behave in a protective way, andfinally adopted fewer protective behaviors. Developers of intervention strategiesand campaigns should contemplate such variables and focus on differencesaccording to age.

TI  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in coronavirus disease 2019 patients.
PG  - 443-449
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000859 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) has significantmorbidity and UGIB cases have been described in coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) patients. Management of this condition can be challenging considering both the possible severe COVID-19-related pneumonia as well as the risk of thevirus spreading from patients to health operators. The aim of this paper is toreview the most recent studies available in the literature in order to evaluatethe actual incidence of UGIB, its clinical and endoscopic manifestations and its optimal management. RECENT FINDINGS: UGIB has an incidence between 0.5% and 1.9% among COVID-19 patients, and it typically presents with melena or hematemesis.Peptic ulcers are the most common endoscopic findings. High Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), dialysis, acute kidney injury and advanced oncological diseaseincrease the risk for UGIB. Although anticoagulants are commonly used in COVID-19patients they are not associated with an increased incidence of UGIB.Conservative management is a common approach that results in similar outcomescompared to upper GI endoscopic treatment. Apparently, UGIB in COVID-19 seems nothave a detrimental effect and only one study showed an increased mortality inthose who developed UGIB during hospitalization. SUMMARY: Incidence of UGIB inCOVID-19 patients is similar to that of the general population. Despite thewidespread use of anticoagulants in these patients, they are not associated with an increased risk of UGIB. Conservative management could be an effective option, especially for patients that are at risk of intubation.

TI  - Diagnosis of COVID-19 associated arthritis in patients with or without underlyingrheumatic and musculoskeletal disease supported by musculoskeletal ultrasound: a case series from three European centres.
LID - 10.55563/clinexprheumatol/an1yrh [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic concerns the field of rheumatology in many ways. Arthritis in conjunction with COVID-19 is increasinglyreported. However, clinical data are still limited and there is lack of adetailed characterisation of COVID-19 associated arthritis by musculoskeletalultrasound (MSUS). This case series reports different forms of COVID-19associated arthritis supported by MSUS in patients with or without underlyingrheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD). METHODS: From March 2020 to July2021, adult patients (n=10) with arthritis timely related to COVID-19 wereassessed in three European centres by clinical and laboratory values andadditionally MSUS. RESULTS: In the group without underlying RMD (n=6), twopatients presented with polyarticular arthralgia during severe COVID-19, swellingwas rarely seen and MSUS demonstrated arthritis only in a few joints affected.The other four patients showed arthritis four to 16 weeks after mild or moderate COVID-19 (without hospitalisation): polyarthritis (n=1), oligoarthritis of theupper and lower limb (n=2), and in one case, late-onset rheumatoid arthritis(LORA) was newly diagnosed. In the group with an underlying RMD (n=4), anincrease of disease activity was reported by MSUS during mild and mild-moderateCOVID-19. In general, MSUS often presented power Doppler (PD) positive synovitis and tenosynovitis. CONCLUSIONS: In our patients without underlying RMD,arthritides associated with COVID-19 are comparable to the clinical picture of a reactive arthritis (ReA) or other virus-related arthritides (e.g. parvovirusB19). New onset or flares of RMD possibly triggered by COVID-19 are noteworthy.

TI  - alpha-SAS: an integrative approach for structural modeling of biologicalmacromolecules in solution.
PG  - 1046-1063
LID - 10.1107/S2059798322006349 [doi]
AB  - Modern small-angle scattering (SAS) experiments with neutrons (SANS) or X-rays(SAXS) combined with contrast variation provide comprehensive information aboutthe structure of large multicomponent macromolecules in solution and allow thesize, shape and relative arrangement of each component to be mapped out. Toobtain such information, it is essential to perform well designed experiments, inwhich all necessary steps, from assessing sample suitability to structuremodeling, are properly executed. This paper describes alpha-SAS, an integrativeapproach that is useful for effectively planning a biological contrast-variation SAS experiment. The accurate generation of expected experimental intensitiesusing alpha-SAS allows the substantial acceleratation of research into thestructure and function of biomacromolecules by minimizing the time and costsassociated with performing a SAS experiment. The method is validated using a few basic structures with known analytical expressions for scattering intensity andusing experimental SAXS data from Arabidopsis beta-amylase 1 protein and SANSdata from the histidine kinase-Sda complex and from human dystrophin without and with a membrane-mimicking nanodisk. Simulation of a SANS contrast-variationexperiment is performed for synthetic nanobodies that effectively neutralizeSARS-CoV-2.

However, when transitions occurduring a global pandemic, isolation and disconnect with schools and the communitycreate new challenges that impact health and well-being. The MAPS21 studyuncovers the lived experiences of military-connected students who haveexperienced a transition during the pandemic and gives rise to the need forinterdisciplinary care within the public-school setting to promote mental health and academic support during and post-pandemic transitions. METHODS: Militaryadolescents and their parent(s) were interviewed and data were analyzed followingan interpretive phenomenological process. A social-ecological model served as theguide to understand the participants' experiences and to further inform futuresupportive measures. RESULTS: Seven subthemes surface under Individual,Relationships, Community, and Society and Policy, the levels within thesocial-ecological model. These subthemes included: anticipatory processes,control, growth and maturity, adapting views, isolation, school support,community support. CONCLUSION: Military-connected students may experience adverseoutcomes relating to mental health and academic progression after experiencing a move during the pandemic. This study provides an avenue for teams ofinterdisciplinary professionals to collaborate within the public-school settingto provide proactive support through engagement and policy development.

TI  - The Impact of Distance Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic on PhysicalActivity and Well-Being of Czech and Polish Adolescents.
LID - 10.1111/josh.13232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the changes in the structure ofweekly physical activity (PA) and well-being among adolescent boys and girlsbetween habitual education (HE) and distance education (DE) during the pandemicin secondary schools. METHODS: The research was carried out in 12 Czech and 18Polish schools during 2019 to 2020 academic session for HE and 2020 to 2021academic session for DE. The research involved 723 girls and 626 boys aged 15 to 18 years. The structure of the weekly PA was assessed using the InternationalPhysical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form, while well-being was assessed usingthe World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index. RESULTS: There was astatistically significant decrease of PA among boys in school PA, transportation PA, recreation PA, vigorous PA, moderate PA, walking, and overall weekly PAduring the DE resulting from the pandemic. In girls, during DE, a decrease wasobserved in school PA, vigorous PA, and overall PA. During DE, a high level ofwell-being was reported by only 34.9% of girls (43.8% during HE) and 50% of boys (65.6% during HE). CONCLUSIONS: The observed low PA and high incidence ofdepressive symptoms in adolescents in distance education during pandemicconstraints are a challenge for schools to change in supporting physicalactivity, eliminating similar negative impacts on school life in the future.

TI  - COVID-19 CT image segmentation based on improved Res2Net.
LID - 10.1002/mp.15882 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: COVID-19 is threatening the health of the global people, and bringinggreat losses to our economy and society. However, computed tomography (CT) image segmentation can make clinicians quickly identify the COVID-19 infected regions. Accurate segmentation infection area of COVID-19 can contribute screen confirmed cases. METHODS: We designed a segmentation network for COVID-19 infected regions in CT images. To begin with, multi-layer features were extracted by the backbone network of Res2Ne. Subsequently, edge features of the infected regions in thelow-level feature f2 were extracted by the edge attention module (EAM). Secondly,we carefully designed the structure of the attention position module (APM) toextract high-level feature f5 and detect infected regions; Finally, we proposed acontext exploration module (CEM) consisting of two parallel explore blocks, whichcan remove some false positives and false negatives to reach more accuratesegmentation results. RESULTS: Experimental results show that, on the publicCOVID-19 dataset, the Dice, sensitivity, Specificity, Salpha , Eslashed circle(mean) and MAE of our method are 0.755,0.751, 0.959, 0.795, 0.919 and 0.060respectively. Compared with the latest COVID-19 segmentation model Inf-Net, theDice similarity coefficient of our model has increased by 7.3%; the sensitivity(Sen) has increased by 5.9%. in contrary, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) hasdropped by 2.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Our method performs well on COVID-19 CT imagesegmentation. We also find that our method is so protable that can be suitablefor various current popular networks. In a word, our method can help screenpeople infected with COVID-19 effectively, and save the labor power of cliniciansand radiologists. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Combination therapy with remdesivir and immunomodulators improves respiratorystatus in COVID-19: A retrospective study.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28037 [doi]
AB  - Immunomodulators (tocilizumab/baricitinib) improve outcomes of coronavirusdisease (COVID-19) patients, but the synergistic effect of remdesivir is unknown.The effect of combination therapy with remdesivir, immunomodulators, and standardtreatment in COVID-19 patients was investigated. This retrospective,single-center study included COVID-19 patients who were treated with tocilizumab or baricitinib. The severity of respiratory status in the two groups on day 14and day 28 and the duration to respiratory recovery in both groups were compared,and the effect of remdesivir use on respiratory status was examined in amultivariate analysis. Ninety-eight patients received tocilizumab or baricitinib;among them, 72 used remdesivir (remdesivir group) and 26 did not (control group).The remdesivir group achieved faster respiratory recovery than the control group (median 11 days vs. 21 days, p=0.033), faster weaning from supplemental oxygen(HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.14-5.66, p=0.021). Age, body mass index, diabetes mellitus,and time from onset to oxygen administration were independent prognostic factors.The remdesivir group achieved better severity level at days 14 and 28 (p=0.033and 0.003, respectively) and greater improvement from baseline severity (p=0.047 and 0.018, respectively). Remdesivir combination therapy did not prolong survival(HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.04-2.16, p=0.23). Among severely ill COVID-19 patients whoreceived immunomodulator, remdesivir contributed to a shorter respiratoryrecovery time and better respiratory status at days 14 and 28. Concomitantremdesivir with immunomodulators and standard treatment may provide additionalbenefit in improving respiratory status of COVID-19 patients. This article isprotected by copyright.

TI  - FDA MAUDE database reported adverse events on noninvasive body contouring,cellulite treatment, and muscle stimulation from 2015 to 2021.
LID - 10.1002/lsm.23592 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive cosmetic procedures have continued to gain popularity,owing to their short, in-office treatments combined with little to no downtime.These procedures are also highly accessible, even offered at medical spas bynonphysician operators. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic also sawheightened interest in all cosmetic procedures, presumably as social distancingand stay-at-home orders allotted time and space for postop recovery. As themarket for these procedures expand, a thorough understanding of potential adverseevents is critical for providers to better counsel their patients on risks andexpectations when obtaining informed consent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility DeviceExperience (MAUDE) database(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm), whichcompiles medical device reports (MDRs) for suspected injuries from device use or malfunction, submitted by manufactures and operators. We focused our query onthree main categories: noninvasive body contouring, cellulite treatments, andmuscle stimulation therapies that utilize electromagnetic energy. The query wasperformed in February 2022 using a comprehensive list of product names andmanufacturers. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 827 MDRs, which wereindividually reviewed for duplicate reports or insufficient data. Ultimately, 723MDRs were analyzed (660 for noninvasive body contouring, 55 for cellulitetreatment, and 8 for muscle stimulation). Paradoxical hyperplasia accounted forthe majority of MDRs for noninvasive body contouring, while burns and scars were most common for muscle stimulation and cellulite treatments, respectively. Of the7-year span we surveyed, 2021 accounted for 515 of the 723 total assessed MDRs(71.2%), the majority of which were from cryolipolysis procedures. CONCLUSION:The MAUDE database remains an essential tool to monitor potential adverse events of medical devices, including those utilized for noninvasive, cosmeticprocedures. Insight from the MAUDE database can be clinically translated whendiscussing treatment options with patients, helping to optimize patient safetyand satisfaction.

TI  - Teaching through the screen: a toolbox for creating a virtual neurosurgicalsubinternship program.
PG  - E7
LID - 10.3171/2022.5.FOCUS22171 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted thelandscape of traditional neurosurgical subinternships, ramifications of whichpersist to this day. The outright cancellation of in-person subinternships in2020 presented not only a challenge to both applicants and programs, but also an opportunity to establish an effective and efficient platform for virtualneurosurgical training. To address this need, the authors designed and trialed a novel virtual neurosurgical subinternship (Virtual Sub-I). METHODS: The weeklong,case-based Virtual Sub-I program combined flipped-classroom and active learningapproaches. Students worked in small groups to discuss neurosurgical cases.Faculty and residents offered personalized mentorship sessions to participants.Surveys were used to assess students' experience with the authors' subinternship program, consistent with level 1 of the Kirkpatrick model. RESULTS: A total of132 students applied from both international and American medical schools. Thefinal cohort comprised 27 students, of whom 8 (30%) were female and 19 (70%) weremale. Students characterized the subinternship as "interactive," "educational,"and "engaging." One hundred percent of survey respondents were "very likely" torecommend the Virtual Sub-I to their peers. Faculty involved in the Virtual Sub-Istated that the program allowed them to determine the fit of participatingmedical students for their neurosurgery residency program, and that informationgathered from the Virtual Sub-I had the potential to influence their rankingdecisions. CONCLUSIONS: The Virtual Sub-I recapitulates the educational andinterpersonal benefits of the traditional subinternship experience and can serve as a prototype for future virtual surgical education endeavors. Furthermore, the Virtual Sub-I presents a more equitable platform for introducing medical studentsacross the undergraduate medical education spectrum to neurosurgical educationand mentorship.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Training of residents is an essential but time-consuming and costlytask in the surgical disciplines. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,surgical education became even more challenging because of the reduced caseloaddue to the increased shift to corona care. In this context, augmented 360 degrees3D virtual reality (VR) videos of surgical procedures enable effective off-sitetraining through virtual participation in the surgery. The goal of this study wasto establish and evaluate 360 degrees 3D VR operative videos for neurosurgicaltraining. METHODS: Using a 360 degrees camera, the authors recorded threestandard neurosurgical procedures: a lumbar discectomy, brain metastasisresection, and clipping of an aneurysm. Combined with the stereoscopic view ofthe surgical microscope, 7- to 10-minute 360 degrees 3D VR videos augmented with annotations, overlays, and commentary were created. These videos were thenpresented to the neurosurgical residents at the authors' institution using ahead-mounted display. Before viewing the videos, the residents were asked to fillout a questionnaire indicating their VR experience and self-assessment ofsurgical skills regarding the specific procedure. After watching the videos, the residents completed another questionnaire to evaluate their quality andusefulness. The parameters were scaled with a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS:Twenty-two residents participated in this study. The mean years of experience of the participants in neurosurgery was 3.2 years, ranging from the 1st through the 7th year of training. Most participants (86.4%) had no or less than 15 minutes ofVR experience. The overall quality of the videos was rated good to very good.Immersion, the feeling of being in the operating room, was high, and almost allparticipants (91%) stated that 360 degrees VR videos provide a useful addition tothe neurosurgical training. VR sickness was negligible in the cohort.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the authors demonstrated the feasibility and highacceptance of augmented 360 degrees 3D VR videos in neurosurgical training.Augmentation of 360 degrees videos with complementary and interactive content hasthe potential to effectively support trainees in acquiring conceptual knowledge. Further studies are necessary to investigate the effectiveness of their use inimproving surgical skills.

TI  - PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF TRAUMATIC MEMORIES IN COVID-19 SURVIVORS.
LID - 10.1002/cpp.2771 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected a significant number of individualsworldwide, is generating serious mental health issues. Recovered COVID-19patients have experienced traumatic events related to their symptoms, isolation, possible hospitalization, bereavement, fear of infecting loved ones, and thephysical consequences of COVID-19. One effective psychological treatment forthese patients is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). The aimof this paper is to describe the therapeutic intervention and effects of EMDR in a pool of COVID-19 survivors referred to an integrated psychological/psychiatric outpatient service. Twelve patients, comprising of nine males and three females, underwent EMDR psychotherapy from October 2020 to February 2022. Each patientreceived 8 to 16 weekly treatment sessions. The standard EMDR protocol of eightstages was administered to enable desensitization and reprocessing of four maintargets: first positive swab, hospitalization, isolation, and fear for relatives'health. Efficacy of EMDR was demonstrated by the significant improvement atclinical scale for subjective distress caused by traumatic events. For thetherapists, carrying out these treatments was an intense and challengingexperience. In fact, the perceived distance between therapist and patient wasless defined than in other hospital settings because the pandemic affectseveryone equally. However, with the widespread availability of vaccines andalthough the pandemic is still ongoing with the emergence of new variants, awindow of improvement in the mental health landscape is starting to open up.

AB  - The World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) aglobal pandemic in March 2020. Several vaccines have been developed to overcomethe COVID-19 pandemic, and messenger RNA vaccines, commonly known as mRNAvaccines, were the first COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized in Korea. With theworldwide increase in vaccinations, reports of adverse reactions are increasing. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of eosinophilicgastroenteritis (EGE) following mRNA vaccination. Here, we present the first caseof EGE in a patient who received a second dose of the mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2(Pfizer-BioNTech). A previously healthy 34-year-old woman presented to theemergency department with generalized abdominal pain for the preceding 2 weeks.She had received a second dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks prior.Subserosal EGE was diagnosed, oral prednisolone was administered, and sherecovered completely.

TI  - When 3D genome technology meets viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28040 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian chromosomes undergo varying degrees of compression to formthree-dimensional genome structures. These three-dimensional structures undergodynamic and precise chromatin interactions to achieve precise spatial andtemporal regulation of gene expression. Most eukaryotic DNA viruses can invadetheir genomes into the nucleus. However, it is still poorly understood how theviral genome is precisely positioned after entering the host cell nucleus to findthe most suitable location and whether it can specifically interact with the hostgenome to hijack the host transcriptional factories or even integrate into thehost genome to complete its transcription and replication rapidly. Chromosomeconformation capture technology can reveal long-range chromatin interactionsbetween different chromosomal sites in the nucleus, potentially providing areference for viral DNA-host chromatin interactions. This review summarized theresearch progress on the three-dimensional interaction between virus and hostgenome and the impact of virus integration into the host genome on genetranscription regulation, aiming to provide new insights into chromatininteraction and viral gene transcription regulation, laying the foundation forthe treatment of infectious diseases.

LID - e2022057564 [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2022-057564 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is limited evidence on whether the relative severity ofcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children and adolescents differs fordifferent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants. We comparethe risk of hospitalization to acute COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatorysyndrome in children (MIS-C) among unvaccinated persons <18 years with COVID-19(cases) between waves of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (sublineage BA.1) variantsin Norway. METHODS: We used linked individual-level data from national registriesto calculate adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) usingmultivariable log-binomial regression. We adjusted for variant wave, demographic characteristics, and underlying comorbidities. RESULTS: We included 10 538 Alpha (21 hospitalized with acute COVID-19, 7 MIS-C), 42 362 Delta (28 acute COVID-19, 14 MIS-C), and 82 907 Omicron wave cases (48 acute COVID-19, 7 MIS-C). The riskof hospitalization with acute COVID-19 was lower in the Delta (aRR: 0.53, 95% CI:0.30-0.93) and Omicron wave (aRR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.24-0.68), compared to the Alphawave. We found no difference in this risk for Omicron compared to Delta. The riskof MIS-C was lower for Omicron, compared to Alpha (aRR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03-0.27) and Delta (aRR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.10-0.63). CONCLUSIONS: We do not find clearevidence that different variants have influenced the risk of hospitalization withacute COVID-19 among unvaccinated children and adolescents in Norway. The lowerrisk of this outcome with Omicron and Delta may reflect changes in other factors over time, such as the testing strategy, maternal vaccination and/orhospitalization criteria. The emergence of Omicron has reduced the risk of MIS-C.

LID - 10.1542/peds.2021-055190 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Assess how family stressors (including structural stressors, socialdeterminants of health inequities, and parent psychological distress) relate tomedia rule implementation and problematic child media use during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: Nationally representative survey of 1000 UnitedStates parents with at least one 6 to 17 year old child was conducted in October through November 2020. RESULTS: Problematic use was greater in families whereparents were employed full time, present in the home (eg, working from home), hadlow levels or formal educational attainment, and were experiencing morepsychological distress. Although there was a small decline in the number ofmedia-related rules implemented during the pandemic (fewer parents enforcedscreen limits on weekdays or weekends or limited screen use at mealtimes), there was no association between rule implementation and problematic media use.CONCLUSIONS: Family stressors were associated with problematic child media useduring the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As we emerge from the pandemic, it will be important to help parents adjust their family's media practices cognizantof the fact that additional children may have developed problematic screen usebehaviors. Such efforts should center the role of structural and socialdeterminants of health inequities on the stressors that families experience andthat impact media use.

TI  - Overview and applications of map and model validation tools in the CCP-EMsoftware suite.
LID - 10.1039/d2fd00103a [doi]
AB  - Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently been established as apowerful technique for solving macromolecular structures. Although the bestresolutions achievable are improving, a significant majority of data are stillresolved at resolutions worse than 3 A, where it is non-trivial to build or fitatomic models. The map reconstructions and atomic models derived from the mapsare also prone to errors accumulated through the different stages of dataprocessing. Here, we highlight the need to evaluate both model geometry and fitto data at different resolutions. Assessment of cryo-EM structures fromSARS-CoV-2 highlights a bias towards optimising the model geometry to agree with the most common conformations, compared to the agreement with data. We presentthe CoVal web service which provides multiple validation metrics to reflect thequality of atomic models derived from cryo-EM data of structures from SARS-CoV-2.We demonstrate that further refinement can lead to improvement of the agreementwith data without the loss of geometric quality. We also discuss the recentCCP-EM developments aimed at addressing some of the current shortcomings.

TI  - COVID-19 and vaccination during pregnancy: a systematic analysis using KoreaNational Health Insurance claims data.
LID - 10.5468/ogs.22060 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study systematically analyzed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)and vaccination details during pregnancy by using the national health insuranceclaims data. Methods: Population-based retrospective cohort data of 12,399,065women aged 15-49 years were obtained from the Korea National Health InsuranceService claims database between 2019 and 2021. Univariate analysis was performed to compare the obstetric outcomes of pregnant women (ICD-10 O00-O94) and theirnewborns (ICD-10 P00-P96) with and without COVID-19. Univariate analysis was alsoperformed to compare the age and obstetric outcomes of pregnant women receivingdifferent types of vaccines. Results: The percentage of pregnant women withCOVID-19 during pregnancy was 0.11%. Some obstetric outcomes of pregnant womenwith COVID-19, including the rates of preterm birth or cesarean delivery, weresignificantly better than those of pregnant women without COVID-19. The rate ofmiscarriage was higher in pregnant women with COVID-19 than without COVID-19.However, the outcomes of newborns of women with and without COVID-19 were notsignificantly different. Regarding vaccination type, obstetric outcomes ofpregnant women appeared to be worse with the viral vector vaccine than with themRNA vaccine. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first studyto systematically analyze COVID-19 and vaccination details during pregnancy usingthe national health insurance claims data in Korea. The obstetric outcomes inpregnant women with and without COVID-19 and their newborns were similar.

AB  - During the 2020-21 academic year, COVID-19-related educational disruptionsimpacted school-based vision screenings. However, limited information regardingchanges in vision screening and the number of students impacted has beenreported. Delayed screenings can negatively impact students' referral to eye careproviders, which may affect a child's ability to see clearly and academicsuccess. This study aims to describe changes in school-based vision screeningpractices through a survey of National Association of School Nurses staterepresentatives (n = 49). Among states with vision screenings mandates,participants reported that 23.7% (9/38) states waived screenings, 31.6% (12/38)continued screenings, and 36.8% (14/38) modified requirements, such as gradesscreened or assessments included (e.g., color vision and stereoacuityscreenings). These results suggest that millions of students across the UnitedStates missed vision screenings during the 2020-21 academic year. Efforts byeducation and school health stakeholders should be directed towards addressingthe pandemic-related disruption in vision screening.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The popularity of video consultations in healthcare has acceleratedduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite increased availability and obviousbenefits, many patients remain hesitant to use video consultations. This studyinvestigates the relative importance of the consultation mode compared to otherattributes in patients' appointment choices in Germany. METHODS: A discretechoice experiment was conducted to examine the influence of appointmentattributes on preferences for video over in-clinic consultations. A total of 350 participants were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The level of continuity ofcare (46%) and the waiting time until the next available appointment (22%) wereshown to have higher relative importance than consultation mode (18%) and otherattributes. Participants with fewer data privacy concerns, higher technologyproficiency, and more fear of COVID-19 tended to prefer video over in-clinicconsultations. The predicted choice probability of a video over a typicalin-clinic consultation and opting out increased from <1% to 40% when the videoconsultation was improved from the worst-case to the best-case scenario.CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into the effect of the consultation mode on appointment choice at a time when telemedicine gains momentum. The resultssuggest that participants preferred in-clinic over video consultations.Policymakers and service providers should focus on increasing the level ofcontinuity of care and decreasing the time until the next available appointmentto prompt the adoption of video consultations. Although participants preferred totalk to their physician in person over consulting via video per se, the demandfor video consultations can be increased significantly by improving the otherappointment attributes of video consultations such as the level of continuity of care.

PG  - 8850666221118271

AB  - Introduction: Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (IPVD) have been previously studied in patients with non-coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The use of IPVD has been shown to improve the partialpressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), reduce fraction of inspired oxygen(FiO2) requirements, and ultimately increase PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratios in ARDSpatients. However, the role of IPVD in COVID-19 ARDS is still unclear. Therefore,we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the role of IPVD in COVID-19patients. Methods: Comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web ofScience and Cochrane Library databases from inception through April 22, 2022 was performed for all published studies that utilized IPVD in COVID-19 ARDS patients.The single arm studies and case series were combined for a 1-arm meta-analysis,and the 2-arm studies were combined for a 2-arm meta-analysis. Primary outcomesfor the 1-arm and 2-arm meta-analyzes were change in pre- and post-IPVD P/Fratios and mortality, respectively. Secondary outcomes for the 1-armmeta-analysis were change in pre- and post-IPVD positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and lung compliance, and for the 2-arm meta-analysis the secondaryoutcomes were need for endotracheal intubation and hospital length of stay (LOS).Results: 13 single arm retrospective studies and 5 case series involving 613patients were included in the 1-arm meta-analysis. 3 studies involving 640patients were included in the 2-arm meta-analysis. The pre-IPVD P/F ratios weresignificantly lower compared to post-IPVD, but there was no significantdifference between pre- and post-IPVD PEEP and lung compliance. The mortalityrates, need for endotracheal intubation, and hospital LOS were similar betweenthe IPVD and standard therapy groups. Conclusion: Although IPVD may improveoxygenation, our investigation showed no benefits in terms of mortality compared to standard therapy alone. However, randomized controlled trials are warranted tovalidate our findings.

LID - 10.1177/00333549221114346 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about parents' willingness to vaccinate their childrenagainst COVID-19. We assessed the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among parentswith a child or adolescent aged 12-15 years, examined predictors of parents'COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, their reasons for resisting a pediatric COVID-19vaccine, and the correlation between parents' intentions to vaccinate their childand the acceptance of a vaccine for themselves. METHODS: We conducted a national online survey of 637 parents of a child or adolescent aged 12-15 years in March2021, before COVID-19 vaccines had been approved for this age group. We assessed univariate predictors of vaccine hesitancy, and we used logistic regressionanalysis to assess independent effects of variables on vaccine hesitancy.RESULTS: Nearly one-third (28.9%; 95% CI, 25.5%-32.5%) of respondents reportedpediatric vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine-hesitant parents were less knowledgeableabout vaccines, more accepting of vaccine conspiracies, and less worried aboutCOVID-19 risks to their child's health than vaccine-accepting parents were.Vaccine hesitancy was higher among female (vs male), single (vs married/living asmarried), older (vs younger), low income (vs high income), non-college graduates (vs college graduates), and Republican (vs Democrat) parents. The primaryconcerns expressed by vaccine-hesitant parents pertained to vaccine safety ratherthan vaccine effectiveness. One-quarter of vaccine-hesitant parents preferredthat their child obtain immunity through infection rather than vaccination.Non-vaccine-hesitant parents' reasons for vaccinating focused on protecting thehealth of their child and others. Childhood COVID-19 vaccine acceptance wasstrongly associated with parents' intentions to get the vaccine for themselves.CONCLUSION: A messaging strategy for effective public health interventions thatincludes educating the public about vaccination, countering misinformation about vaccine development and safety, and stressing the safety of approved COVID-19vaccines may boost vaccine acceptance among vaccine-hesitant parents.

AB  - In summer 2021, the Pima County Health Department (PCHD) developed andimplemented a multiresource event model for vaccine clinics to increase access toCOVID-19 vaccines and other resources, such as food, rental assistance, andpublic health services, in Pima County, Arizona, communities. The PCHD aimed toimprove vaccine access in areas with vaccination rates <40% by involvingcommunity partners to plan a multiresource event with resources (eg, food,connection to economic resources, information on childcare, and heat relief)andincentives specific to community needs that could drive attendance. Resourceswould be made available to community members regardless of whether they received a COVID-19 vaccine at the event. The PCHD selected census tract 41.15 as thepilot group to apply the multiresouce COVID-19 vaccine event model. Census tract 41.15 is a heat-stressed area of Pima County comprising mostly Latino people and people with lower incomes and is an area with low vaccination rates for COVID-19.The vaccination rate increased in census tract 41.15 by 12.8 percentage points(absolute increase), starting at 33.9% on June 1, 2021, and increasing to 46.7%as of September 1, 2021. In addition, attendance at the pilot event versusattendance at previous events that did not use this model increased by >100%. Themultiresource COVID-19 vaccine event, when held within a hyperlocal area and whenthe needs of residents in the community are considered, can improve vaccineuptake. This model provides a roadmap for COVID-19 vaccine delivery in areas oflow uptake.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Smartphone-based digital exposure notification (EN) tools wereintroduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to supplement strained case investigationand contact tracing efforts. We examined the influence of an EN tool implemented in Washington State, WA Notify, on user engagement in behaviors that protectagainst COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: From January 25 through June 30, 2021, weadministered 2 surveys to WA Notify users who received notification of a possibleCOVID-19 exposure. The initial survey, sent when users received a notification,focused on intent to engage in protective behaviors. The follow-up surveycaptured data on self-reported actual engagement in protective behaviors andcontact by a public health contact tracer. RESULTS: Of 1507 WA Notify users whocompleted the initial survey, 40.1% (n = 604) reported intending to seek COVID-19testing and 67.1% (n = 1011) intended to watch for COVID-19 symptoms. Of 407respondents to the follow-up survey, 57.5% (n = 234) reported getting tested and 84.3% (n = 343) reported watching for COVID-19 symptoms. Approximately 84% (n =1266) of respondents to the initial survey received a notification from WA Notifybefore being reached by public health contact tracers; on follow-up, 42.5% (n =173) of respondents reported never being contacted by public health. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings suggest that WA Notify users may initiate protective behaviorsearlier than nonusers who will not know of an exposure until notified by publichealth or by a known contact. Digital EN tools may be a valuable addition toexisting public health outbreak investigation and response activities.

AB  - There are limited data on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines; the humoralimmune response; and main clinical laboratory parameters as indicators fordisease severity and mortality in patients with critical and mild COVID-19without comorbidities or immune-mediated diseases in Saudi Arabia. We determined the expression levels of major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines;C-reactive protein (CRP); procalcitonin; SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody and twenty-twoclinical laboratory parameters and assessed their usefulness as indicators ofdisease severity and in-hospital death. Our results showed a significant increasein the expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody; IL1-beta; IL-6; IL-8;TNF-alpha and CRP in critical COVID-19 patients; neutrophil count; urea;creatinine and troponin were also increased. The elevation of these biomarkerswas significantly associated and positively correlated with in-hospital death in critical COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that the levels of IL1-beta;IL-6; IL-8; TNF-alpha; and CRP; neutrophil count; urea; creatinine; and troponin could be used to predict disease severity in COVID-19 patients withoutcomorbidities or immune-mediated diseases. These inflammatory mediators could be used as predictive early biomarkers of COVID-19 disease deterioration; shock and death among COVID-19 patients without comorbidities or immune-mediated diseases.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore parental perspectives on the impactof parent restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic acrossCanadian Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). A co-designed online survey wasconducted targeting parents (n = 235) of infants admitted to a Canadian NICU fromMarch 1, 2020, until March 5, 2021. Parents completed the survey from 38 CanadianNICUs. Large variation in the severity of policies regarding parental presencewas reported. Most respondents (68.9%) were classified as experiencing highrestrictions, with one or no support people allowed in the NICU, and felt thatpolicies were less easy to understand, felt less valued and respected, and found it more challenging to access medicine or health care. Parents reported gaps incare related to self-care, accessibility, and mental health outcomes. There issignificant variation in parental restrictions implemented across Canadian NICUs.National guidelines are needed to support consistent and equitable carepractices.

TI  - Is the Omicron variant truly less virulent in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients?
LID - 10.1111/tid.13923 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at high risk for severedisease with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection. Emerging variants of concern have disproportionately affected thispopulation. Data on severity and outcomes with the Omicron variant in SOTrecipients is limited. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study of SOT recipients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from December 18, 2021, to January18, 2022, when prevalence of the Omicron variant was more than 80 - 95% in thecommunity. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performedto identify risk factors for hospital admission. RESULTS: We identified 166 SOTpatients; 112 (67.5%) kidney, 22 (13.3%) liver, 10 (6.0%) lung, 7 (4.2%) heart,15 (9.0%) combined transplants. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series was completed in 59(35.5%) recipients. Ninety-nine (59.6%) and 13 (7.8%) recipients receivedcasirivimab/imdevimab and sotrovimab, respectively. Fifty-three (32%) recipients required hospital admission, of which 19 (35.8%) required intensive care unitlevel of care. Median follow up was 50 (IQR, 25 - 59) days, with mortalityreported in 6 (3.6%) patients. Risk factors identified for hospital admissionwere African American race (p<0.001, Odds ratio [OR] 4.00, 95% ConfidenceInterval [CI] 1.84 - 8.70), history of coronary artery disease (p = 0.031, OR3.50, 95% CI 1.12 - 10.87), and maintenance immunosuppression withcorticosteroids (p = 0.048, OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.01 - 4.00). CONCLUSION: Contrary tothat in the general population, we found a higher hospital admission rate in SOT recipients with omicron variant infection. Further studies to investigate theefficacy of newer treatments are necessary, even as outcomes continue to improve.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Convalescent Plasma in Older Adults with COVID-19: A Systematic Review andMeta-Analysis.
LID - 10.4235/agmr.22.0045 [doi]
AB  - Background: Among all patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),the older adult population was the most affected, with 80%-90% of fatalitiesoccurring in this group. The effectiveness of convalescent plasma (CP) in olderadults is considerably more restricted than that in adults, resulting in a demandfor data on the efficacy of therapeutic CP in older adults. This meta-analysis ofupdated literature examined the effect of CP in older adults with COVID-19.Methods: Relevant literature was identified from studies indexed in the Cochrane,PubMed, and Google Scholar databases between December 2019 and April 2022. Theprimary outcome was all-cause mortality. Risk estimates were pooled using arandom-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed by regression-based Eggertest using the relative risk (RR) and upper and lower confidence intervals (CIs) of the three included studies. Results: Among 377 studies identified, threefull-text studies that included 1,038 patients met the inclusion criteria. Theresults of our meta-analysis showed that CP administration lowered the mortality risk in older adults with COVID-19 (RR=0.47; 95% CI, 0.26-0.86; p=0.01; I2=0%,p<0.81). CP therapy was more useful if delivered early in the course of thedisease (within 72 hours of onset) and in less severe stages of the disease.Mortality tended to be lower in the high-titer group. Conclusions: CP treatmentwas significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality in older adults with COVID-19 than in patients not administered CP. The timing of CP administration iscritical since earlier treatment after disease onset was associated with a betterprognosis.

PG  - 34894221115753
LID - 10.1177/00034894221115753 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to a temporary lapse in the development ofotolaryngology trainee operative skills due to the cancellation of electiveprocedures and redeployment of trainees and attendings to COVID-19 units.Although transient, this disruption provided an opportunity for otolaryngologyprograms to develop contingency plans and formalize nascent simulation trainingcurricula. Integration of formal simulation training alongside current didacticand surgical education may offset lost exposure during surgically lean timeswhile providing the framework and resources for enhanced baseline training. Here,we provide an up-to-date overview of surgical simulation models in otolaryngologyand identify easily implementable, low-cost, low fidelity models for juniortrainees. By taking advantage of rapid advancements in technology and a paradigm shift to a more hands-on approach in medical education, formal simulationtraining may prove to be a beneficial tool at all stages of residency training,allowing for expanded peer-mentored skill development and providing a safe haven during unforeseen disruptions in surgical case volume.

TI  - Increased monocyte distribution width in COVID-19 and sepsis arises from acomplex interplay of altered monocyte cellular size and subset frequency.
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13941 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Monocyte distribution width (MDW), a parameter generated alongside full blood counts (FBC) in new-generation haematology analysers, has beenproposed as a diagnostic test for severe infection/sepsis. It represents thestandard deviation (SD) of the monocyte mean volume (MMV). METHODS: This studyaimed to compare monocyte volumetric parameters retrieved by the UniCel DxH 900haematology analyser (MMV and MDW) against corresponding parameters from the samesample measured using flow cytometry (forward scatter [FSC] mean and SD) incombination with phenotypic characterization of monocyte subtypes. We analysedblood samples from healthy individuals (n = 11) and patients with conditionsassociated with elevated MDW: sepsis (n = 26) and COVID-19 (n = 15). RESULTS:Between-instrument comparisons of monocyte volume parameters (MMV vs. FSC-mean)showed relatively good levels of correlation, but comparisons across volumevariability parameters (MDW vs. FSC-SD) were poor. Stratification on sample type revealed this lack of correlation only within the sepsis group. Flow cytometryanalysis revealed that in healthy controls intermediate monocytes are the largestand non-classical the smallest cells. In each disease state, however, eachmonocyte subset undergoes different changes in volume and frequency that togetherdetermine the overall configuration of the monocyte population. Increased MDW wasassociated with reduced classical monocyte frequency and increased intermediatemonocyte size. In COVID-19, the range of monocyte sizes (smallest to largest)reduced, whereas in sepsis it increased. CONCLUSION: Increased MDW in COVID-19and sepsis has no single flow cytometric phenotypic correlate. Itrepresents-within a single value-the delicate equipoise between monocyte subsetfrequency and size.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease with SARS-CoV-2 viral infection (COVID-19) and itsdiverse courses of disease from mild to critical illness frequently is not onlyan acute disease, but will - in a proportion of those affected - lead to organstructure and body function deficits that still exist or become apparent afterthe acute stage of disease. When clinically relevant symptoms or functionaldeficits (impairments) are documented more than four weeks after COVID-19 onset, the syndrome is called "Long-COVID", from 12 weeks after onset onwards"Post-COVID".In such cases and when everyday life functioning or return to workare affected by persisting deficits specialized rehabilitation treatment isindicated. An individual medical, frequently multi-professional diagnosticevaluation is mandatory in that situation: For adequate treatment, it isimportant to identify and objectify the individually underlying health conditionsbased on knowledge about the diverse potential consequences of COVID-19, toassess type and severity of functional consequences (impairments, activitylimitations, and restrictions of participation) of Long-/Post-COVID individually,and then to decide on the treatment necessities and plans. With regard torehabilitation, need and decision for either pulmonary, neurological, cardiac, orpsychosomatic rehabilitation depends on the individual medical presentation.

TI  - Mental health and COVID-19: The impact of a virtual course for family caregivers of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
LID - 10.1111/jir.12965 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted family caregivers ofadults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). This studyevaluated a virtual course for family caregivers from across Canada, focused onsupporting the mental health and well-being of adults with IDD and theirfamilies. The evaluation examined the feasibility and acceptability of thecourse, as well as the impact of the intervention on participants' overall healthand well-being. METHODS: The 6-week virtual course, informed by a parallelExtension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) course for service providers, combined didactic instruction with applied activities. A total of 126 familycaregiver course participants consented to be part of the research evaluationdelivered over three cycles between October 2020 and April 2021. Attendance wasmeasured at each weekly session. Satisfaction was assessed weekly andpost-program. Learning, self-efficacy, and well-being were assessed pre- andpost-course, and again at follow-up (8 weeks post-course). Mixed-effects modelsassessed changes between and within individuals across time. RESULTS:Participants had consistent attendance, low-dropout rates, and reported highsatisfaction, with 93% of participants reporting that their expectations for the course were met. Compared with pre-course, participants reported improvedself-efficacy and well-being post-course, which were maintained at follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: An interactive and applied virtual education course delivered to alarge group of family caregivers of adults with IDD was both feasible andacceptable. It positively impacted participants' well-being by offering muchneeded mental health support and creating a peer-led community of practice.

LID - 10.1016/j.ins.2022.07.146 [doi]
AB  - This study demonstrates the major role played by the healthcare andpharmaceutical industries during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, itprovides evidence of a better risk-return relationship in these sectors through amultivariate study of monthly frequency. A global and dynamic ratio is developed to summarize different investor profiles according to their attitude toward risk and to consider the dynamic and changing nature of the economy and financialmarkets. This global ratio synthesizes the information from different orders ofKappa indices and Farinelli-Tibiletti ratios into a single measure. Additionally,we verify that Principal Component Analysis allows summarizing the informationcontained in the initial variables from the first new component. Our findingsconfirm that a filtering asset screening rule strategy is relevant and necessary.In this respect, passive management of midterm equal-weighted pharmaceuticalportfolios outperforms both the pure financial and the healthcare investmentstrategies used during the pandemic.

TI  - COVID-19 Lockdown, Family Migration and Unemployment in a Gendered Society.
LID - 10.1016/j.rie.2022.07.010 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has posed severe challenges not only to researchers in the field ofmedicines and natural sciences but also to policymakers. Almost all nations ofthe world lockdown have been chosen as an immediate response to this pandemiccrisis. The labour market in developing economies continues to be gendered withgender-based wage differentials besides occupational segregation, women who arethe marginalized section in the society, bear the brunt of the unprecedentedCOVID-19 lockdown. Against this backdrop, a multi-sectoral general equilibriummodel has been constructed with heterogeneity in migration (with and withoutfamily migration) that has been derived from the intra-household bargainingproblem among unskilled families to analyze the gendered effect of the pandemic. Lockdown has been conceptualized as a restriction on the physical gathering oflabour in the contact-intensive sectors. The results of the paper reflectinternal contradictions of developing economies that have aconditional-conditioning relationship with an archaic structure.

TI  - Association between periodontitis and COVID-19 severity in a tertiary hospital: Aretrospective cohort study.
LID - 10.1016/j.sdentj.2022.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by biofilmaccumulation resulting in loss of periodontal attachment which could be linked tosystemic implications. Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease causedby SARS-CoV-2 that triggers damage to the lungs and other organs. COVID-19 andperiodontitis share similar risk factors such as smoking, obesity, old age, anddiabetes mellitus. Studies noted that periodontitis along with some systemicdiseases has increased mortality. Thus, this study aims to examine theassociation of periodontitis with COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: This observational study included periodontitis group and non-periodontitis group for COVID-19outcome assessment. Inclusion criteria were applied to select adults (>/=18years old) who showed at least one dental visit, and were isolated or admitted due to aCOVID-19 complication (i.e. in-ward, ICU, or death). Exclusion criteria werepatients with no active dental records. The periodontal status was examined from posterior bitewings and panoramic radiographs. The primary outcome assessed wasCOVID-19 complications versus no admission. Results and discussion: This studywas the first of its kind as a retrospective cohort study to assess theassociation between periodontitis and COVID-19 severity in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Our findings revealed that periodontitis is statistically associated withCOVID-19 severity. Periodontitis patients were three times more likely to haveCOVID-19 complications (p=0.025). Diabetes (p=0.004) and hypertension (p=0.016)patients were 3.5 times more likely to have COVID-19 complications. Conclusion:Understanding the potential association between periodontitis and COVID-19through systemic inflammation might be a pathway to achieve high quality medical care.

AB  - Presently, the whole world is suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic. In thisharmful situation, using information and Internet technology is mandatory for thegovernment and medical practitioners. After the lockdown, the government needs totake important decisions to allow passengers to travel through air, rail, andland. In the present situation, people need to get a medical report from thehospitals to travel through various modes of transport. In this regard, theCovid-19 history of the passengers plays an important role in issuing tickets to the passengers. Hence, in this paper, a novel authentication method usingInterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is suggested to retrieve the Covid-19 historyof all passengers to determine whether to issue tickets and allow people totravel through various modes of transport. The government can share the Covid-19 status of passengers with the ticket issuing authority. The medical practitionerscan share medical reports and medical images of such people for telediagnosis. Toprovide security, a novel privacy-preserving storage and sharing of Covid-19records using secure authentication and image cryptosystem are proposed usingchaos, cryptographic hash (SHA-256), Paillier cryptosystem, and IPFS. Securityanalysis shows that the system can withstand various kinds of attacks.

TI  - Changes in lifestyle during the COVID-19 lockdown in Brazil: Impact on sleepquality.
PG  - 100033
LID - 10.1016/j.sleepe.2022.100033 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the influence of lifestyle changes made during the COVID -19 lockdown on sleep quality in a Brazilian population. We conducted an onlinecross-sectional study with 589 Brazilians that completed an online questionnaire about sociodemographic variables (age/status/cohabitation/education), generalhabits (exercise/work), and sleep quality (Mini Sleep Questionnaire). Poissonregression (log-linear) was used to examine sleep quality risk factors. 41.93% ofthe population reported impaired sleep quality during lockdown. Increased alcoholconsumption, worsened diet quality, and use of bed for work during lockdown were risk factors for worsening sleep quality. Increased or beginning physicalactivity during lockdown was protective against poor sleep quality, as was malesex. Our results suggest that habit change during COVID -19 affected sleepquality in a general Brazilian population. However, it is important to be awareof whether these positive/negative habits acquired during the interdictionpersist after the pandemic.

TI  - Investigation of COVID-19 Misinformation in Arabic on Twitter: Content Analysis.
PG  - e37007
LID - 10.2196/37007 [doi]
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been occurring concurrently with aninfodemic of misinformation about the virus. Spreading primarily on social media,there has been a significant academic effort to understand the English side ofthis infodemic. However, much less attention has been paid to the Arabic side.Objective: There is an urgent need to examine the scale of Arabic COVID-19disinformation. This study empirically examines how Arabic speakers use specific hashtags on Twitter to express antivaccine and antipandemic views to uncovertrends in their social media usage. By exploring this topic, we aim to fill a gapin the literature that can help understand conspiracies in Arabic aroundCOVID-19. Methods: This study used content analysis to understand how 13 popular Arabic hashtags were used in antivaccine communities. We used Twitter AcademicAPI v2 to search for the hashtags from the beginning of August 1, 2006, untilOctober 10, 2021. After downloading a large data set from Twitter, we identified major categories or topics in the sample data set using emergent coding. Emergentcoding was chosen because of its ability to inductively identify the themes that repeatedly emerged from the data set. Then, after revising the coding scheme, we coded the rest of the tweets and examined the results. In the second attempt and with a modified codebook, an acceptable intercoder agreement was reached(Krippendorff alpha>/=.774). Results: In total, we found 476,048 tweets, mostlyposted in 2021. First, the topic of infringing on civil liberties (n=483, 41.1%) covers ways that governments have allegedly infringed on civil liberties duringthe pandemic and unfair restrictions that have been imposed on unvaccinatedindividuals. Users here focus on topics concerning their civil liberties andfreedoms, claiming that governments violated such rights following the pandemic. Notably, users denounce government efforts to force them to take any of theCOVID-19 vaccines for different reasons. This was followed by vaccine-relatedconspiracies (n=476, 40.5%), including a Deep State dictating pandemic policies, mistrusting vaccine efficacy, and discussing unproven treatments. Although users tweeted about a range of different conspiracy theories, mistrusting the vaccine'sefficacy, false or exaggerated claims about vaccine risks and vaccine-relateddiseases, and governments and pharmaceutical companies profiting from vaccinesand intentionally risking the general public health appeared the most. Finally,calls for action (n=149, 12.6%) encourage individuals to participate in civildemonstrations. These calls range from protesting to encouraging other users totake action about the vaccine mandate. For each of these categories, we alsoattempted to trace the logic behind the different categories by exploringdifferent types of conspiracy theories for each category. Conclusions: Based onour findings, we were able to identify 3 prominent topics that were prevalentamongst Arabic speakers on Twitter. These categories focused on violations ofcivil liberties by governments, conspiracy theories about the vaccines, and callsfor action. Our findings also highlight the need for more research to betterunderstand the impact of COVID-19 disinformation on the Arab world.

PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1007/s11133-022-09512-8 [doi]
AB  - Sociology's focus on sociality and co-presence has long oriented studies ofcommensality-the social dimension of eating together. This literature commonlyprioritizes face-to-face interactions and takes physical proximity for granted.The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 largely halted in-persongatherings and altered everyday foodways. Consequently, many people turned todigital commensality, cooking and eating together through video-call technologysuch as Zoom and FaceTime. We explore the implications of these new foodways and ask: has digital commensality helped cultivate co-presence amidstpandemic-induced physical separation? If so, how? To address these questions, we analyze two forms of qualitative data collected by the first author: interviewswith individuals who cooked and ate together at a distance since March 2020 anddigital ethnography during different groups' online food events (e.g., happyhours, dinners, holiday gatherings, and birthday celebrations). Digitalcommensality helps foster a sense of co-presence and social connectedness at adistance. Specifically, participants use three temporally oriented strategies to create or maintain co-presence: they draw on pre-pandemic pasts and reinventculinary traditions to meet new circumstances; they creatively adapt noveldigital foodways through online dining; and they actively imagine post-pandemicfutures where physically proximate commensality is again possible.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causativeagent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has been spreadingworldwide since December 2019, resulting in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with237 million infections and 4.8 million deaths by 11 October 2021. While there aregreat efforts of global vaccination, ending this pandemic has been challenged by issues of exceptionally high viral transmissibility, re-infection,vaccine-breakthrough infection, and immune escape variants of concern. Besidesthe record-breaking speed of vaccine research and development, antiviral drugsincluding SARS-CoV-2-specific human neutralizing antibodies (HuNAbs) have beenactively explored for passive immunization. In support of HuNAb-basedimmunotherapy, passive immunization using convalescent patients' plasma hasgenerated promising evidence on clinical benefits for both mild and severeCOVID-19 patients. Since the source of convalescent plasma is limited, thediscovery of broadly reactive HuNAbs may have significant impacts on the fightagainst the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, therefore, we discuss the current technologies of gene cloning, modes of action, in vitro and in vivo potency andbreadth, and clinical development for potent SARS-CoV-2-specific HuNAbs.

PG  - 53-58
LID - 10.1016/j.ecns.2021.04.021 [doi]
AB  - Virtual simulation has been widely used to temporarily replace face-to-faceclinical practicum experiences in nursing education in response to the globalCOVID-19 pandemic. While more traditional clinical settings were prioritized and made available only to senior students, the use of virtual simulation provided anopportunity to safely pivot from the usual placement to a comparable practicallearning modality to maintain clinical competence during unprecedented publichealth restrictions and mitigation strategies. Like many others across the globe,nursing students in a Canadian university continued their nursing educationpredominantly using virtual simulation for an entire academic year to avoidcatastrophic delays in entering the workforce and to ultimately protect thehealth service delivery needs throughout the oncoming waves of the pandemic. The purpose of the paper is to describe guiding principles established in a School ofNursing as a means to responsibly and ethically adopt a replacement oftraditional clinical practicum experiences with virtual simulation. Theprinciples for incorporating virtual simulation included the need to achieve and maintain a high level of quality of learning experiences, a fluid deliveryarticulated in phases, and a financial commitment by the learning institution. Asthe global pandemic may see a fourth wave, the use of virtual simulation willcontinue to present a major change for clinical practicum and establishingprinciples for the use of virtual simulation has demonstrated to be an integralpart of safe pandemic response and post-pandemic recovery.

AB  - Background: The Alberta Health Services' Provincial Simulation Program (eSIM) is Canada's largest simulation program. The eSIM mobile simulation programspecializes in delivering simulation-based education (SBE) to rural and remotecommunities (RRC). During the COVID-19 pandemic, a quality improvement projectinvolving rapid cycle in situ virtually facilitated simulation (VFS) for COVID-19airway management and health systems preparedness in RRC was successfullyimplemented. Methods: Between April 24 and July 31, 2020, a team of six ruralsimulationists (four nurses and two physicians) provided 24 VFS sessions withvirtual debriefing to 200 health care providers distributed across 11 RRC inAlberta and the Northwest Territories, covering a geographic area ofapproximately 169,028 km(2). Results: Video analysis of sequential VFS rapidcycle sessions using a standardized observational tool indicated decreasedpersonal protective equipment (PPE) breaches by 36.6% between the first and thirdcycles. Teams demonstrated increased competency with airway management such ascorrect use of bag-valve-mask ventilation, and implementation of health systemprocess improvements, such as incorporation of an intubation checklist.Improvements occurred on average over 2.2 rapid cycles completed within 1.3 weeksper RRC. Postsession self-reported participant electronic surveys indicatedself-reported improvement in clinical management, teamwork behavior, and healthsystems issues outcome measures which were categorized based on the CrisisResource Management and Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS)frameworks. Of the 48 survey respondents, 86.1% reported that VFS was equivalent or superior to in-person simulation. The cost of VFS was 62.9% lower thancomparable in-person SBE. Conclusion: VFS provides a rapidly mobilizable andcost-effective way of delivering high-quality SBE to geographically isolatedcommunities.

PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1007/s11042-022-13368-z [doi]
AB  - Research aimed at finding solutions to the problem of the diffusion of distinctforms of non-genuine information online across multiple domains has attractedgrowing interest in recent years, from opinion spam to fake news detection.Currently, partly due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak and the subsequentproliferation of unfounded claims and highly biased content, attention hasfocused on developing solutions that can automatically assess the genuineness of health information. Most of these approaches, applied both to Web pages andsocial media content, rely primarily on the use of handcrafted features inconjunction with Machine Learning. In this article, instead, we propose a health misinformation detection model that exploits as features the embeddedrepresentations of some structural and content characteristics of Web pages,which are obtained using an embedding model pre-trained on medical data. Suchfeatures are employed within a deep learning classification model, whichcategorizes genuine health information versus health misinformation. The purpose of this article is therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model,namely Vec4Cred, with respect to the problem considered. This model represents anevolution of a previous one, with respect to which new features and architecturalchoices have been considered and illustrated in this work.

AB  - Objective: Internet of Things (IoT) integrates several technologies where deviceslearn from the experience of each other thereby reducing human-intervened likely errors. Modern technologies like IoT and machine learning enable the conventionalto patient-specific approach transition in healthcare. In conventional approach, the biggest challenge faced by healthcare professionals is to predict a diseaseby observing the symptoms, monitoring the remote area patient, and also attendingto the patient all the time after being hospitalised. IoT provides real-timedata, makes decision-making smarter, and provides far superior analytics, and allthese to help improve the quality of healthcare. The main objective of the workwas to create an IoT-based automated system using machine learning models forsymptom-based COVID-19 prognosis. Methods: Comparative analysis of predictivemicrobiology of COVID-19 from case symptoms using various machine learningclassifiers like logistics regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vectormachine, random forest, decision trees, Naive Bayes, and gradient booster isreported here. For the sake of the validation and verification of the models,performance of each model based on the retrieved cloud-stored data was measuredfor accuracy. Results: From the accuracy plot, it was concluded that k-NN wasmore accurate (97.97%) followed by decision tree (97.79), support vector machine (97.42), logistics regression (96.50), random forest (90.66), gradient boostingclassifier (87.77), and Naive Bayes (73.50) in COVID-19 prognosis. Conclusion:The paper presents a health monitoring IoT framework having high clinicalsignificance in real-time and remote healthcare monitoring. The findings reportedhere and the lessons learnt shall enable the healthcare system worldwide tocounter not only this ongoing COVID but many other such global pandemics thehumanity may suffer from time to come.

PG  - 7833516
LID - 10.1155/2022/7833516 [doi]
AB  - X-ray images aid medical professionals in the diagnosis and detection ofpathologies. They are critical, for example, in the diagnosis of pneumonia, thedetection of masses, and, more recently, the detection of COVID-19-relatedconditions. The chest X-ray is one of the first imaging tests performed whenpathology is suspected because it is one of the most accessible radiologicalexaminations. Deep learning-based neural networks, particularly convolutionalneural networks, have exploded in popularity in recent years and have becomeindispensable tools for image classification. Transfer learning approaches, inparticular, have enabled the use of previously trained networks' knowledge,eliminating the need for large data sets and lowering the high computationalcosts associated with this type of network. This research focuses on using deeplearning-based neural networks to detect anomalies in chest X-rays. Differentconvolutional network-based approaches are investigated using the ChestX-ray14database, which contains over 100,000 X-ray images with labels relating to 14different pathologies, and different classification objectives are evaluated.Starting with the pretrained networks VGG19, ResNet50, and Inceptionv3, networks based on transfer learning are implemented, with different schemes for theclassification stage and data augmentation. Similarly, an ad hoc architecture is proposed and evaluated without transfer learning for the classification objectivewith more examples. The results show that transfer learning produces acceptableresults in most of the tested cases, indicating that it is a viable first stepfor using deep networks when there are not enough labeled images, which is acommon problem when working with medical images. The ad hoc network, on the otherhand, demonstrated good generalization with data augmentation and an acceptableaccuracy value. The findings suggest that using convolutional neural networkswith and without transfer learning to design classifiers for detectingpathologies in chest X-rays is a good idea.

AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isresponsible for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Elderly subjects, obese, andpatients with chronic illnesses, are the most affected group. HDL has pleiotropicphysiological functions that are affected with alteration(s) in its structure.Main text: Inflammation whether septic, immune, or other affects HDL structureand function. COVID-19 is associated with systemic immune-inflammation due tocytokine surge. Viral interaction with erythrocytes and hemoglobin-relatedcompounds (may cause anemia and hypoxia) and other factors may affect HDLfunction. Trials have been conducted to resume HDL functions using peptidepreparation, nutritional, and herbal elements. Conclusions: In this reviewarticle, I'll discuss the use of reconstituted HDL (rHDL), Apo-A1 mimetic peptideD-4F, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the powdered roots and/or extract of Saussurea lappa (costus) to avoid comorbidity and mortality of COVID-19 inpatients with chronic illness or elderly-age mortality.

TI  - Omicron SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in England during February 2022: A series ofcross-sectional community surveys.
PG  - 100462
LID - 10.1016/j.lanepe.2022.100462 [doi]
AB  - Background: The Omicron wave of COVID-19 in England peaked in January 2022resulting from the rapid transmission of the Omicron BA.1 variant. We investigatethe spread and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the population of Englandduring February 2022, by region, age and main SARS-CoV-2 sub-lineage. Methods: Inthe REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study we obtained data from a random sample of 94,950 participants with valid throat and nose swab results by RT-PCR during round 18 (8 February to 1 March 2022). Findings: Weestimated a weighted mean SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 2.88% (95% credible interval[CrI] 2.76-3.00), with a within-round effective reproduction number (R) overallof 0.94 (0.91-0.96). While within-round weighted prevalence fell among children(aged 5 to 17 years) and adults aged 18 to 54 years, we observed a level orincreasing weighted prevalence among those aged 55 years and older with an R of1.04 (1.00-1.09). Among 1,616 positive samples with sublineages determined, one(0.1% [0.0-0.3]) corresponded to XE BA.1/BA.2 recombinant and the remainder were Omicron: N=1047, 64.8% (62.4-67.2) were BA.1; N=568, 35.2% (32.8-37.6) were BA.2.We estimated an R additive advantage for BA.2 (vs BA.1) of 0.38 (0.34-0.41). The highest proportion of BA.2 among positives was found in London. Interpretation:In February 2022, infection prevalence in England remained high with level orincreasing rates of infection in older people and an uptick in hospitalisations. Ongoing surveillance of both survey and hospitalisations data is required.Funding: Department of Health and Social Care, England.

PG  - 1-19
LID - 10.1007/s11097-022-09840-8 [doi]
AB  - This paper addresses how and why social restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic have affected people's experiences of grief. To do so, I adopt a broadlyphenomenological approach, one that emphasizes how our experiences, thoughts, andactivities are shaped by relations with other people. Drawing on first-personaccounts of grief during the pandemic, I identify two principal (and overlapping)themes: (a) deprivation and disruption of interpersonal processes that playimportant roles in comprehending and adapting to bereavement; (b) disturbance of an experiential world in the context of which loss is more usually recognized andnegotiated. The combination, I suggest, can amount to a sort of "grief withingrief", involving a sense of stasis consistent with clinical descriptions ofprolonged grief disorder.

TI  - Bi-objective optimization of a stochastic resilient vaccine distribution network in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 102725
LID - 10.1016/j.omega.2022.102725 [doi]
AB  - This paper develops an approach to optimize a vaccine distribution network designthrough a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model with two objectives:minimizing the total expected number of deaths among the population andminimizing the total distribution cost of the vaccination campaign. Additionally,we assume that a set of input parameters (e.g., death rate, social contacts,vaccine supply, etc.) is uncertain, and the distribution network is exposed todisruptions. We then investigate the resilience of the distribution networkthrough a scenario-based robust-stochastic optimization approach. The proposedmodel is linearized and finally validated through a real case study of theCOVID-19 vaccination campaign in France. We show that the current vaccinationstrategies are not optimal, and vaccination prioritization among the populationand the equity of vaccine distribution depend on other factors than thoseconceived by health policymakers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a vaccination strategy mixing the population prioritization and the quarantine restrictionsleads to an 8.5% decrease in the total number of deaths.

TI  - Cross-cultural measurement invariance of the purpose in life test - Short form(PIL-SF) in seven Latin American countries.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1007/s12144-022-03465-5 [doi]
AB  - The aim was to test the cross-cultural measurement invariance of the PIL-SF in a sample of people from seven Latin American countries. Additionally, thecharacteristics of the PIL-SF items were evaluated and to assess the relationshipbetween purpose in life, as measured by the PIL-SF, and fear of COVID-19. A totalof 4306 people from seven Latin American countries participated in the study. Theresults indicated that the PIL-SF is invariant in the seven participatingcountries and, therefore, there is evidence that the items reflect the purpose oflife in the same way in all countries. This allows comparisons of purpose in lifebetween countries that are free of bias, reflecting the true differences in howcountries respond to items. From IRT, the discrimination parameters are adequate and indicate that the items cover a wide range of the purpose in life construct. The difficulty parameters are adequate and increase monotonically. This indicatesthat people would need a higher level of purpose in life to respond to the higherresponse categories. Thus, the PIL-SF items would be useful in determining peoplewith a relatively high degree of purpose in life. Identifying people withdifferent levels of purpose in life would allow them to be part of interventionprograms, either to support those with low levels or to maintain and reinforcetheir purpose in life. The evidence of cross-country measurement invariance ofthe PIL-SF provides a measure to be used in cross-cultural studies about themeaning of life.

TI  - Psychological strain and suicidal ideation in young university students duringCovid-19 outbreak: the mediating roles of rumination and depression.

LID - 10.1007/s12144-022-03551-8 [doi]
AB  - The link between psychological strain and suicidal ideation is well embedded inliterature, however, the underlying mechanism is rarely explored. Therefore, thisstudy aimed to examine the relationship between psychological strain, suicidalideation, rumination, and depression among Pakistani young adults during theCovid-19 outbreak. In addition, it will also try to determine the mediating role of ruminative subtypes and depression in the relationship between psychologicalstrain and suicidal ideation. The sample consists of 400 university students (83 males and 289 females) with the age range from 18 to 30 years (M = 22.25, SD =2.40). Psychological strain scale, Suicidal Ideation Scale, Beck DepressionInventory, and Ruminative Response Scale were administered to the participants.Results indicated a significant and positive association between the studyvariables. Psychological strain positively influenced suicidal ideation bothdirectly, and indirectly via brooding and depression. Both variables were foundto be serially mediated by the brooding subtype of rumination and depression and not with the reflective subtype. Strain theory of suicide and response styletheory also postulated important insights regarding the association of thesevariables in young adults, among which, strain is serially related to firstbrooding and then depression, which is eventually related to suicidal ideation.The present study makes a significant contribution to the literature by providinga unique conceptual and theoretical framework to identify suicide at the ideationlevel before it proceeds to behavior during this unprecedented time of thepandemic outbreak.

AB  - Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) (also termed thrombosiswith thrombocytopenia syndrome or vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia or vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia) is characterized by (i) venous orarterial thrombosis; (ii) mild-to-severe thrombocytopenia; (iii) positiveantiplatelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion antibodies or anti-PF4-heparin antibodiesdetected by the HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) ELISA; (iv) occurring 5-30days after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) or Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson &Johnson/Janssen) vaccination. VITT's incidence is 1 per 100 000 vaccinated peopleirrespective of age and up to 1 in 50 000 for people <50 years of age with theAstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The exact mechanism by which adenovirus-vectoredCOVID-19 vaccines trigger this syndrome is still unclear, as for the increasedrisk for acute cerebral sinus venous thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis ascompared to other locations of venous thrombotic events. VITT is associated with the detection of anti-PF4 antibodies, unrelated to previous use of heparintherapy. PF4 antibodies are thought to activate platelets via the plateletFcgammaRIIA receptors leading to further platelet activation that causesthrombosis and thrombocytopenia.

PG  - e394
LID - 10.5001/omj.2022.77 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and prophylactic anticoagulanttherapy (PAT) are ongoing topics globally. Using PAT for anti-inflammatory effectmay prevent thromboembolic events (TEEs). The objective of this study was todetermine the anti-inflammatory effects of PAT in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in a tertiary pandemic hospital. Patients were divided into two categories according to their PATtherapy status (PAT (+) and PAT (-)) and into three categories according toclinical features (mild: group 1; moderate: group: 2; and severe: group 3). Wethen evaluated laboratory parameters and clinical courses. Results: We included662 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in this study. Enoxaparin sodium was given to all patients as PAT therapy. TEE was developed in five patients in the PAT (+)group. Pulmonary embolism developed in 3/5 patients and deep venous thrombosis in2/5 patients. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was detected in 54patients in group 3. No statistically significant difference was found in 28-day mortality, development of DIC rates, intubation rates, and TEEs. Conclusions: Theuse of PAT in critically ill patients was not effective in reducing C-reactiveprotein, which is one of the biomarkers of inflammation.

AB  - Background: This study examined the application of interpersonal-psychologicaltheory and early maladaptive schema of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in South Korean university students. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, datafrom 367 university students were surveyed using the Interpersonal NeedsQuestionnaire, Early Maladaptive Schema, Suicide Ideation Scale, and the AcquiredCapability for Suicide Scale. Data were collected between June 21 and July 21,2021. Results: University students' interpersonal needs and early maladaptiveschema were significantly associated with suicidal ideation, and influencingsuicide attempts. The acquired capability for suicide moderated the relationship between suicidal ideation and attempts. Conclusions: In suicide preventionprograms for university students, it is critical to consider their interpersonal needs and early maladaptive schema, and the acquired capability for suicide, toprevent suicidal ideation and attempts among them.

PG  - e13829
LID - 10.7717/peerj.13829 [doi]
AB  - Background: Published studies during the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic have focused on eating and exercise behaviors and failed to portray a comprehensiveunderstanding of the factors associated with weight change in a setting of abehavioral change framework. This study explores factors associated with weightchange during the COVID-19 pandemic among Lebanese residents using the SocialCognitive Theory (SCT) framework, integrating behavioral, environmental, andcognitive factors. Materials & Methods: This study uses a cross-sectional design using an anonymous online survey. Participants were recruited from a tertiaryhospital patient portal and social media posts. The survey included four domains:demographics, cognitive, behavioral, psychological, and environmental factors.Multiple validated self-reported instruments were included Generalized AnxietyDisorder-2 items (GAD-2), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), General SelfEfficacy Scale (GSES), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise(AUDIT-C), and the dietary pattern evaluation tool. Results: A sample of 335complete responses was obtained. Mean age was 39.0 +/- 13.4 years old.Participants were mostly females (n = 224, 66.9%), employed (n = 191, 57.4%),nonsmokers (n = 227, 70.5%), reporting depression (n = 224, 80.3%) and anxiety (n= 242, 84.3%). Mean weight change was -7.0 +/- 6.0 kg in the decrease weightgroup and 6.4 +/- 5.0 kg in the increase group. When compared to stable weight,the multinomial logistic model factors that were found to correlate significantlyto weight gain were: overeating/binge eating (p-value = 0.001) and unbalancedfood pattern (p-value = 0.012). Baseline BMI (p-value = 0.003), anxiety (p-value = 0.020) and smoking (p-value = 0.004) were significant factors of weight loss ascompared to stable weight. Conclusions: COVID-19-related weight change ismultifactorial and is associated with specific behavior and individualcharacteristics. Hence, addressing people's behaviors and relationship to food isvital to control weight change during this continuing and future pandemic ornatural occurrence.

AB  - With the invention of the COVID-19 vaccine, shipping and distributing are crucialin controlling the pandemic. In this paper, we build a mean-field variationalproblem in a spatial domain, which controls the propagation of pandemics by theoptimal transportation strategy of vaccine distribution. Here, we integrate thevaccine distribution into the mean-field SIR model designed in Lee W, Liu S,Tembine H, Li W, Osher S (2020) Controlling propagation of epidemics viamean-field games. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.01249. Numerical examples demonstratethat the proposed model provides practical strategies for vaccine distribution ina spatial domain.

TI  - Are private equity and venture capital helping small and medium-sized enterprisesduring the COVID-19 pandemic? Evidence from China.
LID - 10.1016/j.eap.2022.07.007 [doi]
AB  - The rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide since 2020 has, undeniably, negativelyinfluenced the global economy and environment. Small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) are among the worst-hit victims of COVID-19, particularly in developingcountries. As primary channels financing SMEs, what roles have private equity andventure capital (PE/VC) played in this crisis? Using the 2010-2021 data of 4462listed companies, we aimed to assess the impact of PE/VC on financial risk among Chinese SMEs. We constructed a capital structure selection model to assess therisk preference of PE/VC and explored the roles of PE/VC in the financial riskmanagement of enterprises during COVID-19. Based on both theory and empiricalevidence, PE/VC negatively impacts the financial risk of enterprises, implyingthat intervention by the management of PE/VC can aggravate the financial risk.However, in reality, PE/VC positively impacted enterprise financial risk duringCOVID-19. Thus, the government should implement some easing policies to stimulateaccess and investment policies of PE/VC as well as provide more practicalpolicies to support investment institutions in China and other counties.

AB  - Scientists and regular citizens alike search for ways to manage the widespreadeffects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While scientists are busy in their labs, other citizens often turn to online sources to report their experiences and concernsand to seek and share knowledge of the virus. The text generated by those usersin online social media platforms can provide valuable insights about evolvingusers' opinions and attitudes. The objective of this research is to analyze text of such user disclosures to study human communication during a pandemic in fourprimary ways. First, we analyze Twitter tweet information, generated throughoutthe pandemic, to understand users' communications concerning COVID-19 and howthose communications have evolved during the pandemic. Second, we analyzelinguistic sentiment concepts (analytic, authentic, clout, and tone concepts) in different Twitter settings (sentiment in tweets with pictures or no pictures and tweets versus retweets). Third, we investigate the relationship between Twittertweets with additional forms of internet activity, namely, Google searches andWikipedia page views. Finally, we create and use a dictionary of specificCOVID-19-related concepts (e.g., symptom of lost taste) to assess how the use of those concepts in tweets are related to the spread of information and theresulting influence of Twitter users. The analysis showed a surprisingly lack of emotion in the initial phases of the pandemic as people were information seeking.As time progressed, there were more expressions of sentiment, including anger.Further, tweets with and without pictures and/or video had statisticallysignificant differences in text sentiment characteristics. Similarly, there were differences between the sentiment in tweets and retweets and tweets. We alsofound that Google and Wikipedia searches were predictive of sentiment in thetweets. Finally, a variable representing a dictionary of COVID-related conceptswas statistically significant when related to users' Twitter influence score and number of retweets, illustrating the general impact of COVID-19 on Twitter andhuman communication. Overall, the results provide insights into humancommunication as well as models of human internet and social media use. Thesefindings could be useful for the management of global challenges beyond, ordifferent from, a pandemic.

AB  - Thrombosis following COVID-19 vaccination commonly occurs with vector-basedvaccines. The proposed mechanism is vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia(VITT), with thrombocytopenia as principal manifestation. We present a51-year-old male who came with isolated portal vein thrombosis (PVT) one dayafter Moderna vaccination, without associated thrombocytopenia, challenging VITT as being the only patho-mechanism. Further exploration of these possiblealternative mechanisms is needed for COVID-19 vaccine-related thromboticcomplications.

TI  - The Metaverse as a virtual form of data-driven smart cities: the ethics of thehyper-connectivity, datafication, algorithmization, and platformization of urban society.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1007/s43762-022-00050-1 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in computing and immersive technologies have provided Meta(formerly Facebook) with the opportunity to leapfrog or expedite its way ofthinking and devising a global computing platform called the "Metaverse". Thishypothetical 3D network of virtual spaces is increasingly shaping alternatives tothe imaginaries of data-driven smart cities, as it represents ways of living invirtually inhabitable cities. At the heart of the Metaverse is a computationalunderstanding of human users' cognition, emotion, motivation, and behavior thatreduces the experience of everyday life to logic and calculative rules andprocedures. This implies that human users become more knowable and manageable andtheir behavior more predictable and controllable, thereby serving as passive datapoints feeding the AI and analytics system that they have no interchange with or influence on. This paper examines the forms, practices, and ethics of theMetaverse as a virtual form of data-driven smart cities, paying particularattention to: privacy, surveillance capitalism, dataveillance, geosurveillance,human health and wellness, and collective and cognitive echo-chambers. Achieving this aim will provide the answer to the main research question driving thisstudy: What ethical implications will the Metaverse have on the experience ofeveryday life in post-pandemic urban society? In terms of methodology, this paperdeploys a thorough review of the current status of the Metaverse, urbaninformatics, urban science, and data-driven smart cities literature, as well astrends, research, and developments. We argue that the Metaverse will do more harmthan good to human users due to the massive misuse of the hyper-connectivity,datafication, algorithmization, and platformization underlying the associatedglobal architecture of computer mediation. It follows that the Metaverse needs tobe re-cast in ways that re-orientate in how users are conceived; recognize their human characteristics; and take into account the moral values and principlesdesigned to realize the benefits of socially disruptive technologies whilemitigating their pernicious effects. This paper contributes to the academicdebates in the emerging field of data-driven smart urbanism by highlighting theethical implications posed by the Metaverse as speculative fiction thatillustrates the concerns raised by the pervasive and massive use of advancedtechnologies in data-driven smart cities. In doing so, it seeks to aidpolicy-makers in better understanding the pitfalls of the Metaverse and theirrepercussions upon the wellbeing of human users and the core values of urbansociety. It also stimulates prospective research and further criticalperspectives on this timely topic.

LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab003 [doi]
AB  - Mononuclear phagocytes defend tissues, present antigens, and mediate recovery andhealing. To date, we lack a marker to unify mononuclear phagocytes in humans orthat informs us about their origin. Here, we reassess mononuclear phagocyteontogeny in human blood through the lineage receptor CSF1R, in the steady stateand in COVID-19. We define CSF1R as the first sensitive and reproduciblepan-phagocyte lineage marker, to identify and enumerate all conventionalmonocytes, and the myeloid dendritic cells. In the steady state, CSF1R issufficient for sorting and immuno-magnetic isolation. In pathology, changes inCSF1R are more sensitive than CD14 and CD16. In COVID-19, a significant drop inmembrane CSF1R is useful for stratifying patients, beyond the power of cellcategories published thus far, which fail to capture COVID-19 specific events.Importantly, CSF1R defines cells which are neither conventional monocytes norDCs, which are missed in published analysis. CSF1R decrease can be linked ex vivoto high CSF1 levels. Blood assessment of CSF1R+ cells opens a developmentalwindow to the Mononuclear Phagocyte System in transit from bone marrow totissues, supports isolation and phenotypic characterisation, identifies novelcell types, and singles out CSF1R inhibition as therapeutic target in COVID-19and other diseases.

LID - 10.1155/2022/4270096 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The novel coronavirus nucleic acid results are the core indicators of illness monitoring. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship betweenimmunological features and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by analyzing theclinical and immunological features in nonsevere COVID-19 cases. Methods: Datafrom nonsevere COVID-19 patients admitted to Haihe Hospital from May 2020 to June2021 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: (1) A total of 122cases were reviewed in the present study, including 38 mild and 84 moderatecases. The average age of mild cases was significantly different from moderatecases (P < 0.001). Eight patients complained of hyposmia and it was more frequentin mild cases (P < 0.001). The nucleic acid positive duration (NPD) of nonsevere novel coronavirus was 20.49 (confidence interval (CI) 17.50-3.49) days. (2) Thelevels of specific IgM and IgG for COVID-19 were higher in mild cases than inmoderate cases (P=0.023 and P=0.047, respectively). (3) The correlation analysis with antibodies and T-cell subtypes showed that the lymphocyte (LYM) count, Tcells, CD4(+)T cells, and CD8(+)T cells had a linear correlation with NPD. (4)Among the 93 patients monitored, 62 COVID-19 cases presented a progressive riseof specific IgM and IgG. The daily increase rates of IgM and IgG were 38.42% (CI 28.22-48.61%) and 24.90% (CI 0.23-29.58%), respectively. Conclusion: The levelsand daily increase rates of specific IgM and IgG against the virus can varybetween cases. The NPD presented a linear correlation with the LYM, T cells,CD4(+)T cells, and CD8+T cells. Hence, more attention should be paid to theseindicators in clinical practice.

TI  - Gustatory dysfunction and oral ulceration in COVID-19 patients: A cross sectionalstudy.
PG  - 43
AB  - Background: Over the past year, patients infected by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus-2 presented with severe gustatory dysfunction, theprevalence of which varies among different populations. Furthermore, there havebeen sporadic reports of oral ulceration observed in coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) patients due to varied reasons. The aim of this study was toinvestigate and characterize the presence of gustatory disorders, oralulceration, and other oral changes in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19infection. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, a total of 402 participants who were detected COVID-19 positive by reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction were included. Their demographic andclinical data were recorded through hospital records. The participants wereinterviewed either in person or on the telephone to record any change in tasteand/or changes within the oral cavity. t-test for independent means was used tocompare mean age, while other characteristics were compared by Chi-square testand Z-score test. P < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results: Out of the totalsample of 402 individuals, 262 were male and 140 were female. The prevalence ofgustatory dysfunction and oral ulceration was 43.53% and 15.67%, respectively, inthe studied sample. Significantly more females had gustatory dysfunction thanmales and older subjects more commonly than younger. The symptom of loss/changeof taste and oral ulceration were more probable to occur together. In addition,the tongue was the most common site for ulceration in our studied sample.Conclusion: Loss of taste is a common symptom of COVID-19 patients, whereas oral ulceration is not so commonly reported. However, the presence of both thesesymptoms could impair the quality of life of patients and hamper adequatenutritional uptake.

LID - 10.1016/j.cities.2022.103879 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused enormous detrimental impacts on a global scale. Street vendors are one of the most heavily affected groups since they lack theskills and resources to overcome shocks. This study examines the economic burden facing this group during the pandemic and their coping strategies and mitigation mechanisms in response to these adverse effects. We utilized a mixed-methodsapproach, wherein 91 women vendors completed a survey questionnaire and 15 women vendors were interviewed. These vendors were found to experience a largereduction in business and consumption. The businesses of immigrant vendorssuffered more adverse effects than those of local vendors. Also, the vendorsselling in wet market areas incurred greater economic burdens than those selling near schools or recreation centers. The vendors lacked coping strategies tosustain their businesses and adopted various mitigation mechanisms to ensureessential consumption. This study highlights the need for urban social policiesthat can support this vulnerable group amid a pandemic. We also discuss policyimplications for cities and economic development with a focus on street vendors.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on sleep quality of pharmacy students in UiTM Puncak Alam.
LID - 10.1016/j.jsps.2022.07.009 [doi]
AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the closure of educational institutions wasexecuted during the period of lockdown. This subsequently led to alterations indaily routines and emotional distress, particularly among university students,affecting their sleep quality resulting in disturbance of immune functioning and mood regulation. Hence, the present study aimed to measure students' sleepquality during the first few months of the lockdown period. This study is across-sectional, single-centred survey that was done by distributed electronicquestionnaire. The e-questionnaire was divided into 4 sections that assessedsocio-demographic characteristics, sleep quality, psychological state andengagement in physical activity. Exactly 248 valid responses were received, 82 % female students. Students with poor sleep quality were three times greater thanthose with good sleep quality. No association were found between physicalactivity and sleep quality. However, a significant positive relationship between sleep quality and psychological state was observed (p < 0.01). In conclusion,this study suggests that the majority of pharmacy students in UiTM Puncak Alamare poor sleepers and psychological distress negatively affects sleep qualitybut, is mainly due to stress. Thus, interventions such as stress managementprograms and mental health support can be taken by the faculty's management toovercome this problem.

LID - 10.7759/cureus.26407 [doi]
AB  - Atrial myxomas are the most common primary tumor of the heart and canoccasionally present as an ischemic stroke with neurologic symptoms secondary to embolic phenomena. We present a case of a 42-year-old male with multiplecardiovascular risk factors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection twomonths prior who presented to the emergency department with unilateral left-sidedweakness and paresthesia. After being diagnosed with multifocal ischemic strokes,further evaluation utilizing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a 5 x 2 cm left atrial myxoma prolapsing the mitral valve, which was the presumedcause of the patient's strokes. The myxoma was successfully removed via roboticthoracoscopy. Our case demonstrates the importance of considering atrial myxomain the evaluation of stroke in young and middle-aged patients even in thepresence of multiple cardiovascular and thrombotic risk factors.

PG  - e26453
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26453 [doi]
AB  - Infectious agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmunedisorders for decades. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is no exception. This became evident as the pandemic evolved. Onceconsidered a respiratory pathogen only, SARS-CoV-2 is now linked to a variety of autoimmune rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupuserythematosus, reactive arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, vasculitis, andinflammatory myopathy. Although the exact cause for muscle injury in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not established, autoimmuneinflammatory damage is the most accepted mechanism. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 cancause direct muscle damage and indirectly through a cytokine storm. Inflammatory polymyositis in relation to COVID-19 has seldom been reported in developingcountries. Here, we report a unique case of inflammatory polymyositis in a52-year-old lady. The patient presented with muscle weakness, generalized bodyaches, and fatigue occurring four months after recovering from mild COVID-19. Shehad muscle weakness of Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 3/5 involving theshoulders and pelvic girdle with elevated muscle enzymes. Electromyographyrevealed an active irritable myopathic process consistent with inflammatorypolymyositis. She underwent magnetic resonance imaging-guided muscle biopsy from the right thigh which revealed findings consistent with inflammatory myopathy.She was offered prednisolone and azathioprine. After four weeks of treatment, shehad a remarkable improvement in her muscle strength to MRC grade 5/5.

TI  - Virtual Compared to In-Person Obstetric Anesthesiology Trainee Education Duringthe COVID-19 Pandemic: A Short Report.
PG  - e26423
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic brought many changes to medical training,including in-person education platforms being disbanded and replaced with virtualeducation. At our institution, dedicated obstetric anesthesiology teaching forresidents and fellows occurs daily and is highly valued and rated. In March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we changed the teaching platform from in-person to virtual teaching (via video communication). We subsequently surveyed residents,fellows, and attendings to determine the impact of virtual compared within-person teaching. METHODS: To assess the impact of this change, an electronicsurvey was sent to 10 anesthesiology residents on their 2nd obstetricanesthesiology rotation, and 10 residents on their 1st rotation, respectively.The electronic survey was also sent to three fellows and eight obstetricanesthesiology attendings. Answers were based on a 5-point Likert scale (1 =strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). RESULTS: The results for 1st rotationresidents were higher in all domains compared with 2nd rotation residents andfellows, where "quality" achieved statistical significance (p=0.009) between 1st and 2nd rotation residents. "Engagement" was overall the most impacted domain fortrainees. Attendings did not feel that virtual teaching impacted their ability toprovide adequate education, however, learner engagement was again the lowestrated domain, and teachers strongly favored resuming in-person teaching.CONCLUSIONS: Virtual teaching is an appropriate alternative when in-personteaching is not possible. Future initiatives are needed to improve engagement andbetter facilitate virtual teaching.

TI  - Changes in Internalizing Symptoms and Anxiety Sensitivity Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1007/s10862-022-09990-8 [doi]
AB  - The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic saw significant increases in symptomsof anxiety and depression, particularly among college students. However, researchhas not examined how internalizing symptoms in this population have changed asthe pandemic has continued into its second year. Further, there has yet to be an examination of potential changes in transdiagnostic vulnerability factors.Therefore, the purpose of the current repeated cross-sectional study was toexamine differences by term in undergraduates' symptoms of depression, anxiety,worry, social anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity in the Spring 2020 (n = 251), Fall2020 (n = 427), and Spring 2021 (n = 256) semesters. Results indicated that therewere significant increases in depression, anxiety, worry, and anxiety sensitivityfrom Spring 2020 to Fall 2020 that were maintained through the Spring 2021semester, and levels of social anxiety were significantly higher in Spring 2021compared to Spring 2020. These findings suggest that the mental health impacts ofthe COVID-19 pandemic on college students have continued beyond the initialmonths, and colleges and universities will need to develop comprehensive plans toadequately address college students' mental health needs.

LID - 10.1016/j.csbj.2022.07.042 [doi]
AB  - Co-infection of RNA viruses may contribute to their recombination and causesevere clinical symptoms. However, the tracking and identification of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection persist as challenges. Due to the lack of methods for detectingco-infected samples in a large amount of deep sequencing data, the lineagecomposition, spatial-temporal distribution, and frequency of SARS-CoV-2co-infection events in the population remains unclear. Here, we propose ahypergeometric distribution-based method named Cov2Coinfect with the ability todecode the lineage composition from 50,809 deep sequencing data. By resolving themutational patterns in each sample, Cov2Coinfect can precisely determine theco-infected SARS-CoV-2 variants from deep sequencing data. Results from twoindependent and parallel projects in the United States achieved a similarco-infection rate of 0.3% approximately 0.5% in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples.Notably, all co-infected variants were highly consistent with the co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the regional epidemiology, demonstrating that theco-circulation of different variants is an essential prerequisite forco-infection. Overall, our study not only provides a robust method to identifythe co-infected SARS-CoV-2 variants from sequencing samples, but also highlights the urgent need to pay more attention to co-infected patients for better disease prevention and control.

AB  - In this study, four water quality parameters were reviewed at 14 stations ofriver Ganga in pre-, during and post-lockdown and these parameters were modeledby using different machine learning algorithms. Various mathematical models were used for the computation of water quality parameters in pre-, during and post-lockdown period by using Central Pollution Control Board real-time data. Lockdownresulted in the reduction of Biochemical Oxygen Demand ranging from 55 to 92%with increased concentration of dissolved oxygen at few stations. pH was in rangeof 6.5-8.5 of during lockdown. Total coliform count declined during lockdownperiod at some stations. The modeling of oxygen saturation deficit showedsupremacy of Thomas Mueller model (R (2) = 0.75) during lockdown over StreeterPhelps (R (2) = 0.57). Polynomial regression and Newton's Divided Differencemodel predicted possible values of water quality parameters till 30th June, 2020 and 07th August, 2020, respectively. It was found that predicted and real values were close to each other. Genetic algorithm was used to optimize hyperparameters of algorithms like Support Vector Regression and Radical Basis Function NeuralNetwork, which were then employed for prediction of all examined water qualitymetrics. Computed values from ANN model were found close to the experimental ones(R (2) = 1). Support Vector Regression-Genetic Algorithm Hybrid proved to be veryeffective for accurate prediction of pH, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, DissolvedOxygen and Total coliform count during lockdown.

LID - 10.1016/j.envsci.2022.07.029 [doi]
AB  - The long-term nature of climate policy measures requires stable sociallegitimacy, which other types of crises may jeopardize. This article examines theimpact of the COVID-19 fear on climate change beliefs based on an autumn 2020population survey in the Member States of the European Union and the UnitedKingdom. The results show that deep COVID-19 concerns increase climate changeconcerns, awareness, and perceived negative impacts of climate change. Theseeffects are more robust among the lower educated Europeans. On the country level,strict governmental measures are also linked to deep climate change concerns. In contrast to the experience following the 2008 recession, the findings show that asecondary crisis can positively impact climate attitudes, which is a promisingresult for policy actions.

TI  - Comparative frequency and prognostic impact of myocardial injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and Influenza.
PG  - oeab025
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab025 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Myocardial injury (MINJ) in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) identifies individuals at high mortality risk but its clinical relevance is less wellestablished for Influenza and no comparative analyses evaluating frequency andclinical implications of MINJ among hospitalized patients with Influenza orCOVID-19 are available. Methods and results: Hospitalized adults with laboratory confirmed Influenza A or B or COVID-19 underwent highly sensitive cardiac TTroponin (hs-cTnT) measurement at admission in four regional hospitals in Canton Ticino, Switzerland. MINJ was defined as hs-cTnT >14 ng/L. Clinical, laboratoryand outcome data were retrospectively collected. The primary outcome wasmortality up to 28 days. Cox regression models were used to assess correlationsbetween admission diagnosis, MINJ, and mortality. Clinical correlates of MINJ in both viral diseases were also identified. MINJ occurred in 94 (65.5%) out of 145 patients hospitalized for Influenza and 216 (47.8%) out of 452 patientshospitalized for COVID-19. Advanced age and renal impairment were factorsassociated with MINJ in both diseases. At 28 days, 7 (4.8%) deaths occurred amongInfluenza and 76 deaths (16.8%) among COVID-19 patients with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.69 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.70-8.00]. Adjusted Cox regression models showed admission diagnosis of COVID-19 [HR 6.41 (95% CI 4.05-10.14)] and MINJ [HR8.01 (95% CI 4.64-13.82)] to be associated with mortality. Conclusions:Myocardial injury is frequent among both viral diseases and increases the risk ofdeath in both COVID-19 and Influenza. The absolute risk of death is considerably higher in patients admitted for COVID-19 when compared with Influenza.

AB  - This research estimated the optimal size and composition of the portfolio, andits benefit-cost ratio, of COVID-19 vaccines that Colombia should negotiate as a price-taking country. The Advance Market Commitments (AMC) mathematical model wasapplied using the parameters from the Colombian context and from a literaturereview. The findings indicate that the optimal portfolio of Colombia shouldinclude 13 vaccines, mainly from two platforms: i) RNA and ii) inactivated virus.The benefit-cost ratio was always greater than one in the baseline scenario andafter performing many sensitivity analyses on parameters such as the percentageof the population at risk, the price per treatment, and the herd immunitythreshold, among others. In a context of high uncertainty, the best decision -with high benefit - is to anticipate the negotiation processes with the providersof COVID-19 vaccines, which will generate positive economic and health impacts.

AB  - Alongside the currently used nasal swab testing, the COVID-19 pandemic situation would gain noticeable advantages from low-cost tests that are available atany-time, anywhere, at a large-scale, and with real time answers. A novelapproach for COVID-19 assessment is adopted here, discriminating negativesubjects versus positive or recovered subjects. The scope is to identifypotential discriminating features, highlight mid and short-term effects of COVID on the voice and compare two custom algorithms. A pool of 310 subjects took part in the study; recordings were collected in a low-noise, controlled settingemploying three different vocal tasks. Binary classifications followed, using twodifferent custom algorithms. The first was based on the coupling of boosting and bagging, with an AdaBoost classifier using Random Forest learners. A featureselection process was employed for the training, identifying a subset of featuresacting as clinically relevant biomarkers. The other approach was centred on twocustom CNN architectures applied to mel-Spectrograms, with a customknowledge-based data augmentation. Performances, evaluated on an independent testset, were comparable: Adaboost and CNN differentiated COVID-19 positive fromnegative with accuracies of 100% and 95% respectively, and recovered fromnegative individuals with accuracies of 86.1% and 75% respectively. This studyhighlights the possibility to identify COVID-19 positive subjects, foreseeing atool for on-site screening, while also considering recovered subjects and theeffects of COVID-19 on the voice. The two proposed novel architectures allow for the identification of biomarkers and demonstrate the ongoing relevance oftraditional ML versus deep learning in speech analysis.

AB  - Purpose: Shift work has detrimental effects on healthcare workers, which may befurther compounded by frontline work during the COVID-19 pandemic. We postulated that sleep would worsen and distress would increase during COVID-ward service.Methods: Doctors (n = 18) were recruited from a tertiary centre during the secondwave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia. Participants had beenrostered ON to consecutive 7 day or night shifts and a week OFF over a fortnight.9 worked on COVID wards managing positive/suspected COVID patients, and 9 wereallocated to general MEDICAL wards. Participants wore wrist actigraphy, andcompleted the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS), and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) at baseline and the end of each week. Results: Both the COVID and MEDICAL groups spent less time in bed and had reduced total sleep time during their week ON shift compared to week OFFshift. The COVID group had worse sleep quality (PSQI Delta + 1.0, 6.8 vs 5.8, p =0.036), daytime sleepiness (ESS Delta + 2.6, 8 vs 5.4, p = 0.014) and greaterdistress (K10 Delta + 1.7, 17 vs 15.3, p = 0.002) during their week ON comparedto BASELINE. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic shift workers had poorersleep during their week ON. Those working on COVID wards had greater distressduring their week ON than those working on general MEDICAL wards. It is importantto recognise the potential for sleep deficits and greater distress in medicalworkers during the pandemic.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is theetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 340 million people since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019, resulting inapproximately 55 million deaths. The rapid and effective diagnosis of COVID-19patients is vital to prevent the spread of the disease. In a previous study, wereported a novel temperature-responsive liposome-linked immunosorbent assay(TLip-LISA) using biotinylated-TLip that exhibited high detection sensitivity forthe prostate-specific antigen. Herein, we used immunoglobulin-TLip (IgG-TLip), inwhich the antibodies were directly conjugated to the liposomal surface tosimplify pretreatment procedures and reduce the detection time for SARS-CoV-2.The results indicated that TLip-LISA could detect the recombinant nucleocapsidprotein and the nucleocapsid protein in inactivated virus with 20 min incubation time in total, and the limit of detection was calculated to be 2.2 and 1.0 pg/mL,respectively. Therefore, TLip-LISA has high potential to be used in clinic forrapid diagnosis and disease control.

PG  - 1-33
LID - 10.1007/s12247-022-09665-7 [doi]
AB  - Heparin is a subject of ever-growing interest for laboratory researchers andpharmaceutical industry. One of the driving factors is its critical life-savingdrug status, which during the COVID-19 pandemic has assumed a central role indisease treatment and/or prevention. Apart, heparin is one amongst few drugsenjoying a "demand constant" status. In 2020, heparin market size was valued toUS$6.5 bn., and given the ongoing stability in the COVID-19 health crisis, it is expected to reach US$11.43 bn. by 2027 with yearly growth rate momentum (CAGR) of3.9% during the forecast period (Pepi et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 20:100,025,2021). As patent is a limited monopoly, every year, many patents on low molecularweight heparin (LMWH; a chemically or enzymatically degraded product ofunfractionated heparin) are losing market exclusivity worldwide, inviting thegeneric/biosimilar drug manufacturers to capture market share with cheaper drugproducts. By tracking patent expiration, drugs in patent litigation, regulatorysetbacks for innovator companies (such as those seeking data exclusivity orpatent term extension), or other unexpected events affecting market demand andcompetition, generics can make investment decisions in manufacturing off-patentLMWH drug products of commercial significance. However, given the US Food andDrug Administration (FDA), European Medicine Agency (EMA), Drug RegulatoryAuthority of Pakistan (DRAP), and other regulatory authorities scientificallyrigorous standards for generic/biosimilar LMWH drug products marketing approval, the market is secured and momentous for drug makers that could demonstratethrough scientific and clinical dataset that the generic/biosimilar LMWH drugproduct is of the same quality and purity as the innovator drug product. Thisstudy presents an overview of the patent landscape of commercially availableLMWHs and advanced analytical techniques for their structural and biochemicalcharacterization for quality control and quality assurance during manufacturingand post-marketing. The study also covers FDA, EMA, Health Canada, and DRAP'scurrent approaches to evaluating the generic/biosimilar LMWH drug products forquality, safety including immunogenicity, and efficacy.

AB  - The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic, and the unprecedented social and economic costs it has inflicted, provide an important opportunity to scrutinize the interplaybetween the resilience of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and theresilience of the communities they are embedded in. In this article, wearticulate the specific ways that SMEs play a crucial, and underappreciated role in building resilience to human and natural hazards, and provide newopportunities to accelerate the adoption of sustainability practices through the configuration of 'enabling ecosystems' geared towards promoting sustainability inthe private sector. We argue that capacity-building and experimentation are notonly required within companies, but also throughout this emerging supportiveecosystem of policies, resources (i.e. finance, materials, skills), governanceactors, and intermediaries to adequately focus investment, technical capabilitiesand innovation. Ultimately, we call for a new transdisciplinary action researchagenda that centers on SMEs as pivotal actors and amplifiers of communityresilience; while recognizing that these firms are themselves in need of support to secure their own capacity to respond to, and transform in light of, crises.This research program calls for recognizing and applying the lessons that thepandemic presents to the urgent need for accelerated climate action. This will beenabled by developing more targeted approaches to collaborative capacity-buildingactivities in SMEs that feed into experimentation and allow for the acceleratedadoption of deliberate and strategic resilient business practices and models.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented and unique falloutworldwide and creates colossal disruption in human survival. During the pandemic,social networking sites (SNS) played a significant role in disseminating newsrelated to the pandemic. Methods: This research is based on primary datacollected from 400 successful respondents via online Google Form. BivariatePearson's Chi-square and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis wereperformed to determine the impact of the explanatory variables on the studyvariables. Results: This study reveals that most respondents (n=360, 90%) use SNSto get up-to-date news, and 72.5% (n=290) read health-related information. Thehighest number of participants (n=386, 96.5%) were Facebook users. Multivariatebinary logistic regression reveals that "reading news on SNS" and "sharinginformation related to COVID-19 on social media" significantly influence thespread of awareness of COVID-19. "Unauthentic news sources" and "stop usingsocial media to stay away from panic" also have a substantial impact on thespread of panic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: SNS has become aninevitable medium of information carrier nowadays. Social media users are foundsignificantly aware of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study mightassist the concerned persons in taking the necessary steps to propagate authenticnews and regulate appropriate policies to prevent spreading misinformation.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented global health crisis, rapidly transferredinto a global economic and social crisis. The pandemic has threatened the world'scommitment to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 as governmentsin developing countries have shifted their priorities from attaining SDGs, toproviding urgent financial needs to save lives and prevent recession in hopes fora rapid economic recovery. The rerouting of public funding priorities hasundermined the progress and achievement of SDGs. We employed a mixed-method andcarried out a comparative study using pre- and post-public financial data of two developing countries in South Asia; Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. A threefoldanalysis was conducted to investigate the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic intwo countries, the impact of the pandemic on external and internal public financeand the effect of the pandemic in shifting the policy priorities from SDGs toeconomic survival. This study found that both countries are highly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic and are suffering from the lack of financing from external sources through the private sector as well as an increasing foreign debt. Thereis mounting pressure on the fiscal balance in both countries. SupplementaryInformation: The online version contains supplementary material available at10.1057/s41287-022-00558-6.

PG  - A05
LID - 10.22323/2.21020205 [doi]
AB  - From 'Feed the Birds' to 'Do Not Feed the Animals' takes an engaged approach inwhich science communication is both process and outcome of the research. Theproject started in the UK in March 2020, coinciding with government-imposedlockdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; since the project's engagementhad been designed around in-person interactions, a rapid and creative rethink wasneeded. This paper outlines the redesign of the project and describes a hybridmodel of on-line and in-person engagement, integrating new skills andtechnologies which the pandemic catalysed, with well-established in-personpractice in science communication. Our research develops good practice foronline, participatory science communication, and supports the advancement ofengaged research more widely.

PG  - 9390327
LID - 10.1155/2022/9390327 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 is an acute viral disease that has so far infected more than 200 millionand killed more than four million worldwide. It affects the immune system andother organs. Here, we investigated the level of free plasma amino acids inCOVID-19 patients and compared them with non-COVID-19 subjects. We also compared amino acids levels in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit(ICU) with non-ICU patients and expired and recovered patients. Twenty-sixCOVID-19 patients and 32 non-COVID-19 subjects were included in the study. Themean of glutamic acid, serine, glycine, threonine, phenylalanine, leucine,lysine, alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, and ornithine was significantly higher in cases than controls. In addition, the mean of glutamine was significantlylower in patients than controls (443.89 +/- 254.31 vs. 651.73 +/- 107.38, PV <0.001). Low level of glutamine and isoleucine was seen in the majority of ICU andexpired patients, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed low level of isoleucine as a predictor variable in mortality (P = 0.02, EXP (B) = 16.5, and CI95% = (1.48, -183.07)). There was a positive and significant relationship betweensome amino acids levels, serum liver enzymes, and sodium concentrations. Therewas also a significant but negative correlation between histidine levels, ESR,and ferritin. Phenylalanine had a highly positive relationship with serumprocalcitonin in patients (R (2) = 0.534, PV = 0.015). Our studies have shown thealteration of plasma amino acids concentration in COVID-19 patients. Thesechanges are more evident in critically ill and at-risk patients.

LID - 10.1016/j.sciaf.2022.e01300 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents the first comparative study of emerging stock markets'response to the COVID-19 pandemic with evidence from Ghana and Botswana. Usingdaily time-series data from March 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021, the studyestimates parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric models, and providesevidence to support the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., thetotal number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths) on the stock marketperformances of Ghana and Botswana. Interestingly, the study shows that theimpact of the pandemic on Ghana's stock market is quantitatively greater than thestock market of Botswana. The study calls for fiscal and monetary policies tohelp firms on the stock market to survive the shock. Going forward, measuresaimed at building a robust stock market to withstand such external shocks arecritical.

TI  - EXPLAINABLE FEATURES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGH OR LOW SPREAD OF SARS-COV-2: AFRICAIN VIEW.
PG  - e01301
LID - 10.1016/j.sciaf.2022.e01301 [doi]
AB  - The low spread of the global pandemic in Africa has raised concerns.Consequently, many commentators have misconstrued concerns suspecting weather,and immunity to be prime reasons. This study investigates the factors associated with the high & low spread of the SARS-CoV-2 (also known as COVID-19) and employsgraphical Bayesian models to investigate feature interactions and causality.Through experimentation with the Bayesian framework, we propose that: (i) theproportion of people within the country population who test positive forSARS-CoV-2 and a country's test capacity cause the rate of spread of the virus[i.e., P(S|P) & P(S|T)] (ii) poverty gaps, welfare and freedom of the pressdirectly cause the spread of the virus [i.e., P(S|E), P(S|W), & P(S|R)] (iii)Government effectiveness serves as a parent to poverty gaps and welfare [ i.e.,P(E|G) & P(W|G)] and voice and accountability serve as a parent to freedom of thepress [i.e., P(R|V)]. For the output, we "dichotomized" regions based on the"share of global infection rate" metric (SGIR) that implicitly accounts for agiven region's population, and we find that - out of two hundred and nineteencountries investigated, one hundred and twenty-seven have SGIR >/= 1%, and themajority (44 out 58 - 75.86%) of Africa countries (as at 12th February 2021) haveSGIR < 1%. With Africa in the mirror, the study shows that only 2.2% of theAfrica population has been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and finds that the lowproportion of population tested [i.e., P(S|P)] for SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of thelow spread (i.e., cases reported) of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa. Similarly, thefragmented socioeconomic statuses [i.e., P(S|E)] among citizens leads tosocioeconomic distancing, causing socio-class gaps between the rich andpoor/average citizens, ensuring low interaction in social space, thus limitingthe spread.

AB  - We conducted a systematic literature review on the ethical considerations of the use of contact tracing app technology, which was extensively implemented duringthe COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid and extensive use of this technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, while benefiting the public well-being by providinginformation about people's mobility and movements to control the spread of thevirus, raised several ethical concerns for the post-COVID-19 era. To investigate these concerns for the post-pandemic situation and provide direction for futureevents, we analyzed the current ethical frameworks, research, and case studiesabout the ethical usage of tracing app technology. The results suggest there are seven essential ethical considerations-privacy, security, acceptability,government surveillance, transparency, justice, and voluntariness-in the ethical use of contact tracing technology. In this paper, we explain and discuss theseconsiderations and how they are needed for the ethical usage of this technology. The findings also highlight the importance of developing integrated guidelinesand frameworks for implementation of such technology in the post- COVID-19 world.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary materialavailable at 10.1007/s10676-022-09659-6.

AB  - The risk of developing COVID-19 and its variants may be higher in those withpre-existing health conditions such as thyroid disease, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), breast tissue disease, chronic dermatitis, and other severe infections. Early andprecise identification of these disorders is critical. A huge number of patients in nations like India require early and rapid testing as a preventative measure. The problem of imbalance arises from the skewed nature of data in which theinstances from majority class are classified correct, while the minority class isunfortunately misclassified by many classifiers. When it comes to human life,this kind of misclassification is unacceptable. To solve the misclassificationissue and improve accuracy in such datasets, we applied a variety of databalancing techniques to several machine learning algorithms. The outcomes areencouraging, with a considerable increase in accuracy. As an outcome of theseproper diagnoses, we can make plans and take the required actions to stoppatients from acquiring serious health issues or viral infections.

TI  - Serum hepatic biomarkers in women with obstetric cholestasis and a concurrentSARS-CoV-2 infection.
LID - 10.1111/jog.15383 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between SARS-CoV-2infection and serum hepatic biomarker levels among women with obstetriccholestasis. METHODS: In this prospective study, we recruited all pregnant women admitted in our hospital with obstetric cholestasis. Among those with aconcurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated the following serum hepaticbiomarkers: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), andbiliar acids (BA). RESULTS: Among the 88 women enrolled in the study, 20presented with a SARS-CoV-2 infection while 68 were negative. SARS-CoV-2 infectedwomen were younger (mean age 30.5 +/- 5.7 vs. 34.3 +/- 5.4; p < 0.01) and in agreater percentage of non-Caucasian ethnicity when compared to noninfected women (60.0% vs. 17.6%; p < 0.01). Regarding levels of hepatic biomarkers, they showed higher levels of AST (111.5 +/- 134.1 vs. 37.3 +/- 43.4 UI/L; p = 0.02), ALT(132.2 +/- 115.7 vs. 50.5 +/- 73.173.1 UI/L; p < 0.01), and BA (41.4 +/- 46.8 vs.18.4 +/- 13.4 mumol/L; p = 0.04) compared to noninfected patients. No significantdifferences in maternal or fetal outcomes were found between infected andnoninfected women. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with higherlevels of liver enzymes in patients with obstetric cholestasis. This could be theresult of a possible hepatic involvement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The gut microbiome is intricately coupled with immune regulation and metabolism, but its role in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood.Severe and fatal COVID-19 is characterized by poor anti-viral immunity andhypercoagulation, particularly in males. Here, we define multiple pathways bywhich the gut microbiome protects mammalian hosts from SARS-CoV-2 intranasalinfection, both locally and systemically, via production of short-chain fattyacids (SCFAs). SCFAs reduced viral burdens in the airways and intestines bydownregulating the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), and enhancing adaptive immunity via GPR41 and 43 in male animals. Wefurther identify a novel role for the gut microbiome in regulating systemiccoagulation response by limiting megakaryocyte proliferation and plateletturnover via the Sh2b3-Mpl axis. Taken together, our findings have unravelednovel functions of SCFAs and fiber-fermenting gut bacteria to dampen viral entry and hypercoagulation and promote adaptive antiviral immunity.

LID - 10.1080/14740338.2022.2108398 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacovigilance (PV) activities were affected by COVID-19.Therefore, several health authorities around the world have issued guidelines andpractices to ensure that PV activities are maintained and continued during thepandemic. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the preparednessand performance of national PV systems in 14 Arab countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that was conducted between July andOctober 2020. National PV centres in 18 Arab countries were invited toparticipate in this study. Descriptive analysis was used to summarize and presentthe results of this study. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 14 (77.8%)countries. Adverse events reporting was the main PV activity that was covered by PV guidelines and practices. National guidelines and practices covered other PVactivities in 8 (57.14%) of the participating countries. Performance andpractices of national PV centres vary considerably among participating countries during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the differences inpreparedness and performance of different national PV centres in participatingArab countries. Improving digital infrastructure among participating countriescould serve as a useful tool to minimize the impact of the pandemic on PVactivities.

AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been employed as complementary medication against COVID-19 in China since 2020. Two years since then, TCM, with LianhuaQingwen (LHQW) as an example, has been included in every version of officialclinical protocol guidelines. Recently, LHQW is even distributed to generalpublic at risk but not yet infected. Such common application and widely claimedpositive outcome among mild to moderate patients were accompanied by a number of published studies on antiviral, antiinflammatory, and immune modulatory potentialusing either in vitro or animal models. However, aside from retrospectiveunderstanding and open-labeled clinical trials with relatively small subjectsize, major gap in conclusive proof for efficacy and safety remains due to thelack of double-blind placebo-controlled studies and comprehensive pharmacodynamicand kinetic investigations. This is also supported by a recent WHO expert meetingon this subject, which acknowledged the potential benefits of TCM inmild-moderate cases, while recommended more rigorous studies to furtherunderstand effect size, application implications, and outcome determinants.Therefore, there is an urgent need to address the exact role TCM like LHQW could play in COVID-19 management from translational evidence-based perspective.High-quality clinical trials, pharmacological studies, and real-world data fromrecent outbreak are recommended.

TI  - Modeling the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic-Driven Increases in Alcohol Consumption on Health Outcomes and Hospitalization Costs in the United States.
LID - 10.1111/add.16018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol consumption increased in the early phases of theCOVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and riskydrinking are linked to harmful health effects. This paper aimed to project futurehealth and cost impacts of shifts in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19pandemic. DESIGN: An individual-level simulation model of the long-term drinking patterns for people with lifetime AUD was used to simulate 10,000 individuals andproject model outcomes to the estimated 25.9 million current drinkers withlifetime AUD in the United States. The model considered three scenarios: (1) NoChange (counterfactual for comparison); (2) increased drinking levels persist for1 year ("Increase-1"), and (3) increased drinking levels persist for 5 years("Increase-5"). SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Current drinkers withlifetime AUD. MEASUREMENTS: Life expectancy (or life-years [LYs]),quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), alcohol-related hospitalizations andassociated hospitalization costs, and alcohol-related deaths, over a 5-yearhorizon. FINDINGS: Short-term increases in alcohol consumption (Increase-1scenario) resulted in a loss of 79,000 (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]26,000-201,000) LYs, a loss of 332,000 (104,000-604,000) QALYs, and 295,000(82,000-501,000) more alcohol-related hospitalizations, costing an additional$5.4 billion ($1.5 billion-$9.3 billion), over 5 years. Hospitalizations forcirrhosis of the liver accounted for about $3.0 billion ($0.9 billion-$4.8billion) in hospitalization costs, more than half of the increase across allalcohol-related conditions. Health and cost impacts were more pronounced forolder age groups (51+), women, and non-Hispanic Black individuals. Increasing theduration of pandemic-driven increases in alcohol consumption in the Increase-5scenario resulted in larger impacts. CONCLUSIONS: Simulations show that if theincrease in alcohol consumption observed in the United States in the first yearof the pandemic continues, alcohol-related mortality, morbidity, and associatedcosts will increase substantially over the next 5 years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, different therapeutic lines have been tried in the initial stage of the disease of COVID-19, including remdesivir and molnupiravir. There isscarce evidence on the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in kidney transplantrecipients (KTRs). METHODS: ingle-center prospective cohort study' all adult KTRsdiagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with molnupiravir or remdesivir from January to April 2022 were included. RESULTS: Nine KTRs with SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron variant)infection and mild symptoms received molnupiravir in an outpatient basis and werecompared with a cohort of similar patients treated with remdesivir (n = 7). Threepatients in the molnupiravir cohort were in the early posttransplant period andreceived a basiliximab (n = 2) or antithymocite globulin-based induction (n = 1).One of the patients had been treated with methylprednisolone bolus andantithymocite globulin for an episode of acute rejection in the previous months. They were all vaccinated with mRNA vaccines' and all but 1 had serologicalresponse. Only one of the patients experienced clinical worsening despitemolnupiravir treatment and developed pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Noneof the patients suffered adverse effects attributed to molnupiravir' and noadjustment of tacrolimus dose was needed. None of the patients treated withremdesivir progressed in COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that KTRs with SARS-CoV-2 infection under treatment with molnupiravir have a goodclinical evolution with a probable lower risk for hospitalization and no adverse effects. At the renal level, molnupiravir was well tolerated, with no evidence ofnephrotoxicity secondary to the drug nor interactions with the immunosuppressive therapy.

TI  - Impacts of androgen deprivation therapy on the risks and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2infection in patients with prostate cancer.
LID - 10.4103/aja202246 [doi]
AB  - Studies have investigated the effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) useon the incidence and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19);however, the results have been inconsistent. We searched the PubMed, Medline,Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception to March 2022; 13studies covering 84 003 prostate cancer (PCa) patients with or without ADT metthe eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. We calculatedthe pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to explore theassociation between ADT use and the infection risk of severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and severity of COVID-19. After synthesizing the evidence, the pooled RR in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group was equal to 1.17,and the SARS-CoV-2 positive risk in PCa patients using ADT was not significantly different from that in those not using ADT (P = 0.544). Moreover, no significant results concerning the beneficial effect of ADT on the rate of intensive careunit admission (RR = 1.04, P = 0.872) or death risk (RR = 1.23, P = 0.53) werefound. However, PCa patients with a history of ADT use had a markedly higherCOVID-19 hospitalization rate (RR = 1.31, P = 0.015) than those with no historyof ADT use. These findings indicate that ADT use by PCa patients is associatedwith a high risk of hospitalization during infection with SARS-CoV-2. A largenumber of high quality studies are needed to confirm these results.

LID - 10.4103/jmas.jmas_11_22 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aims: Aerosol protection equipment aim at protecting theanaesthesiologist, from aerosol-borne infections, namely, severe acuterespiratory syndrome corona virus-2. Methods: We improvised the first-generation intubation box (IB) by increasing its dimensions, including heat and moistureexchanger with filter, suction catheter, and attaching arm sleeves to make amodified intubation box (MIB). The impact of IB, MIB and transparent sheets (TS) on the patient outcomes during airway management was evaluated. Results: Asignificant difference in median (interquartile range in minutes) was observed intime to intubate between IB (4 [4-5]); TS (0.5 [0.3-0.5]) and MIB (0.3[0.3-1.5]): P = 0.004); and airway devices; McCoy (0.5 [0.3-2]), CMac (0.5[0.3-1.5]): P = 0.004. First-pass success was 100% with the TS, whereas more thanthree attempts were required with IB 66.7% and 5.2% with MIB. Video laryngoscope was associated with less airway-related adverse events (ARAEs). The need for maskventilation (and hence possible aerosolisation) was maximum with IB. All theARAEs resolved uneventfully. No breach of personal protective equipment wasobserved; none of the health-care professionals involved in patient caredeveloped any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Conclusion: Video laryngoscope is favourable for managing airway in COVID-19 times. In view of the ongoing pandemicand added protection that it offers, it is worthwhile to include the MIB in thearmamentarium for managing the airway of patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Prevalence of peripheral neuropathy and myopathy in patients post-COVID-19infection.
LID - 10.1111/1756-185X.14409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), caused by theCoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), has become a life-threatening epidemic, affectingmultiple organs, including the nervous system. Recent studies have documentedthat COVID-19-associated peripheral neuropathy is a common and frequent problem, with central and peripheral nervous system complications. OBJECTIVE: This workaims to evaluate the peripheral nerves and muscle involvement after COVID-19infection, in addition to studying the prevalence rate and risk factors of their affection. METHODS: The study involved 400 patients, divided into 2 groups, with a history of COVID-19 infection with or without symptoms of neuromuscularaffection, and 30 gender- and age-matched healthy volunteers were involved ascontrols. They were referred to the Department of Rheumatology and Rehabilitationfor electro-diagnosis. All participants performed complete clinical examinationand laboratory measures with an electrophysiological study. RESULTS: Theprevalence of peripheral neuropathy and myopathy in post-COVID-19 patients was56.3% among all patients. A significant difference was detected among patients ofboth groups regarding serum creatine phosphokinase level, clinical signs, andelectrophysiologic findings of neuropathy and myopathy compared to the controlgroup, with more prominent features among the symptomatic group. Histories ofhospitalization, severe and long-lasting respiratory symptoms were risk factorsfor developing neuromuscular complications. CONCLUSIONS: The present study could indicate that muscle involvement and peripheral nerve affection are commonproblems even among asymptomatic patients after COVID-19 infection, especially inthe presence of any risk factors.

TI  - Linking physical activity to personal values: feasibility and acceptabilityrandomized pilot of a behavioral intervention for older adults withosteoarthritis pain.
PG  - 164
LID - 10.1186/s40814-022-01121-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) pain is common and leads to functional impairmentfor many older adults. Physical activity can improve OA outcomes for olderadults, but few are appropriately active. Behavioral interventions can reducephysical activity barriers. We developed and tested a brief, novel behavioralintervention (i.e., Engage-PA) for older adults combining values to enhancemotivation and strategic activity pacing to improve arthritis-related pain andfunctioning and increase physical activity. METHODS: A randomized feasibility andacceptability pilot trial compared Engage-PA to treatment-as-usual plus fitnesstracker (TAU+) in N = 40 adults age 65+ with OA pain in the knee or hip.Engage-PA involved two 60-min telephone sessions. All participants wore a fitnesstracker to collect daily steps throughout the study and completed baseline andpost-treatment assessments of secondary outcomes (arthritis-related pain andphysical functioning, physical activity, psychological distress, psychologicalflexibility, and valued living). The impact of COVID-19 on general well-being andphysical activity was also assessed. Descriptive statistics were conducted forfeasibility and acceptability outcomes. Indicators of improvement in secondaryoutcomes were examined via change scores from baseline to post-treatment andperforming independent samples t-tests to assess for between-group differences.RESULTS: Feasibility was high; 100% accrual, low (5%) attrition, and 100%completion of study sessions. Acceptability was high, with 89% finding theintervention "mostly" or "very" helpful. Engage-PA participants demonstratedimprovements in arthritis pain severity (Mdiff = 1.68, p = 0.044, 95% CI [- 0.26,3.62]) and self-reported activity (Mdiff = 0.875, p = 0.038, 95% CI [- 1.85,0.98]) from baseline to post-treatment as compared to TAU+. Due topandemic-related challenges, there was a high level of missing data (43%) fordaily steps, but available data showed no significant change in steps over timeor between the groups. COVID-19 added an additional burden to participants, such that 50% were exercising less, 68% were more sedentary, and 72% lost access tospaces and social support to be active. CONCLUSIONS: Engage-PA is a promisingbrief, novel behavioral intervention with the potential to support older adultsin improving arthritis-related pain and functioning and increasing physicalactivity. The feasibility and acceptability of Engage-PA are particularly notableas most participants reported COVID-19 added more barriers to physical activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Even though telemonitoring existed prior to COVID-19, the need wasaccelerated for patients with COPD due to the limited medical consultations andthe anxiety for being infected. To our knowledge, no qualitative study hasexplored the experiences of COPD patients and the potential benefits of receivingintegrated telehealth nursing services during the lockdown. METHODS: Tenparticipants were interviewed after receiving telehealth nursing services for 3months; data was analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Irrespective of COPD severity,all participants expressed that the existing fragmented follow-up care wasintensified during COVID. The telenursing services provided them with the comfortand reassurance that a clinician is available for support, advice, and careduring the times of isolation. Despite diverse opinions regarding therespiratory-related questions for follow-up, all were enthusiastic about the use of the oximeter in their daily lives. None perceived sharing data as an issue,instead they encouraged the exchange across levels of care. CONCLUSION: Despitean appreciation for the service, it is imperative for sustainability reasons thatstandardized protocols are developed to balance patient preferences in terms ofresponse frequency and the clinical data needed for a telenurse to provideappropriate interventions.

TI  - Noradrenergic Add-on Therapy with Extended-Release Guanfacine in Alzheimer'sDisease (NorAD): study protocol for a randomised clinical trial and COVID-19amendments.
PG  - 623
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06190-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guanfacine is a alpha2A adrenergic receptor agonist approved fortreating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is thought to actvia postsynaptic receptors in the prefrontal cortex, modulating executivefunctions including the regulation of attention. Attention is affected early inAlzheimer's disease (AD), and this may relate to pathological changes within the locus coeruleus, the main source of noradrenergic pathways within the brain.Given that cholinergic pathways, also involved in attention, are disrupted in AD,the combination of noradrenergic and cholinergic treatments may have asynergistic effect on symptomatic AD. The primary objective of the NorAD trial isto evaluate the change in cognition with 12 weeks of treatment ofextended-release guanfacine (GXR) against a placebo as a combination therapy withcholinesterase inhibitors in participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer'sdisease. METHODS/DESIGN: NorAD is a 3-month, single-centre, randomised,double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of extended-release guanfacine (GXR) in participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. A total of 160participants will be randomised to receive either daily guanfacine or placebo in combination with approved cholinesterase treatment for 12 weeks. The primaryoutcome is the change in cognition, as measured by the Alzheimer's DiseaseAssessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), from baseline to follow-up in thetreatment group compared to the placebo group. Secondary outcomes include thechange in additional cognitive measures of attention (Tests of Attention: Trails A and B, digit-symbol substitution, Test of Everyday Attention and CANTAB-RVP),neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), caregiver burden (ZaritBurden Interview) and activities of daily living (Alzheimer's DiseaseCo-operative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory). From July 2020,observation of change following cessation of treatment is also being assessed.DISCUSSION: There is strong evidence for early noradrenergic dysfunction inAlzheimer's disease. The NorAD trial aims to determine whether guanfacine, anoradrenergic alpha-2 agonist, improves attention and cognition when used inaddition to standard cholinergic treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic in Australia disrupted usual clinical training placements for naturopathic students. An innovative, remote Telehealth clinic wasdeveloped and implemented. This pilot study evaluates student and educatorlearning and teaching experiences in Telehealth. A survey assessed Likert andqualitative written responses to student and staff interaction with theTelehealth clinic. RESULTS: Nine student and 12 educator responses were included in the analysis. All students positively rated Telehealth training resources and the educator support provided. Students rated the Telehealth learning experience as 'very good' (78%) or 'good' (22%) with educator ratings of 'very good' (67%)or 'good' (33%). Thematic analysis of student written responses showed increased client diversity, collaboration, peer learning, increased feedback, and improved digital and technology skills. Virtual physical examination and infrastructurelimitations were reported as Telehealth clinical practicum challenges.Naturopathic Telehealth clinic practicum is a valuable alternative to in-personclinical practicums for Australian students. It enhances student collaborationand peer learning. Challenges of technology, infrastructure and incorporatingTelehealth in curriculum may be barriers to implementation of Telehealth.However, Telehealth is an important clinical training option to prepare studentpractitioners for contemporary professional practice if in-person consultation isprohibitive, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Characterization of compliance phenotypes in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome.
PG  - 296
LID - 10.1186/s12890-022-02087-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distresssyndrome (COVID-19 ARDS) seems to differ from the "classic ARDS", showing initialsignificant hypoxemia in the face of relatively preserved compliance and evolvinglater in a scenario of poorly compliant lungs. We tested the hypothesis that inpatients with COVID-19 ARDS, the initial value of static compliance ofrespiratory system (Crs) (1) depends on the previous duration of the disease(i.e., the fewer days of illness, the higher the Crs and vice versa) and (2)identifies different lung patterns of time evolution and response to pronepositioning. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective observational study.We enrolled consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with a diagnosis ofCOVID-19 who met ARDS criteria, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Patientswere divided in four groups based on quartiles of initial Crs. Relationshipbetween Crs and the previous duration of the disease was evaluated. Respiratoryparameters collected once a day and during prone positioning were comparedbetween groups. RESULTS: We evaluated 110 mechanically ventilated patients with adiagnosis of COVID-19 who met ARDS criteria admitted to our ICUs. Patients weredivided in groups based on quartiles of initial Crs. The median initial Crs was41 (32-47) ml/cmH2O. No association was found between the previous duration ofthe disease and the initial Crs. The Crs did not change significantly over timewithin each quartile. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and drivingpressure were respectively lower and greater in patients with lower Crs. Pronepositioning significantly improved PaO2/FiO2 in the 4 groups, however itincreased the Crs significantly only in patients in lower quartile of Crs.CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the initial Crs is not dependent on the previousduration of COVID-19 disease. Prone positioning improves oxygenation irrespectiveto initial Crs, but it ameliorates respiratory mechanics only in patients withlower Crs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the importance of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccineamong healthcare workers and its role in maintaining their health and inhibiting the epidemic spread of Covid-19, the present study was done to identify thechanges in intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine rate in two different timepoints and it's determinants based on the dimensions of the health belief modelamong healthcare workers in Iran. METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys performed to investigate COVID-19 vaccination intent and associated factors based on thehealth belief model. The first conducted on 1244 participants from August 18 to23, 2020, and the second on 1514 participants from February 5 to April 29, 2021, both using a questionnaire of intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Thequestionnaire distribution platform in both surveys was similarly, WhatsApp andTelegram social and working virtual groups of HCWs. Data were analyzed withSPSS-16 software for descriptive and analytical statistics. RESULTS: In the firstsurvey, 58.4% (95% CI: 0.55-0.61%) of healthcare workers intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, the rate dropped to 45.7% (95% CI: 0.43-0.48%) in the secondsurvey (P < 0.001). The regression analysis indicated six factors that weresignificantly associated with higher intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine: beinga female (OR = 1.84, 95% CI (1.11-3.03)), history of Covid-19 infection (OR =1.54, 95% CI (1.09-2.18), perceptions of Covid-19 disease (OR = 1.13, 95% CI(1.01-1.28)), perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 1.34, 95% CI(1.22-1.47)), prosocial norms for COVID-19 vaccination (OR = 1.25, 95% CI(1.21-1.29)), and COVID-19 vaccine safety/cost concerns (OR = 1.25, 95% CI(1.17-1.33)). CONCLUSIONS: Present study showed an undesirable rate of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers, especially decreasing over the time, emphasize the need of interventions to promote healthcare workers'intention to receive the vaccine and reduce the spread of COVID-19 disease.

TI  - Mixed-methods process evaluation of a residence-based SARS-CoV-2 testingparticipation pilot on a UK university campus during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 1470

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is an important strategy for controlling virus outbreaks onuniversity campuses during the COVID-19 pandemic but testing participation rates can be low. The Residence-Based Testing Participation Pilot (RB-TPP) was a novel intervention implemented at two student residences on a large UK universitycampus over 4 weeks. The aim of the pilot was to increase the frequency ofasymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 saliva testing onsite. This process evaluation aimed todetermine whether RB-TPP was implemented as planned and identify implementationbarriers and facilitators. METHODS: A mixed-methods process evaluation wasconducted alongside the RB-TPP. Evaluation participants were students (opting in,or out of RB-TPP) and staff with a role in service provision or student support. Monitoring data were collected from the intervention delivery team and meetingrecords. Data were collected from students via online survey (n = 152) and seven focus groups (n = 30), and from staff via individual interviews (n = 13).Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and qualitative data thematically. Barriers and facilitators to implementation were mapped to the 'Capability,Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour' (COM-B) behaviour change framework. RESULTS:Four hundred sixty-four students opted to participate in RB-TPP (98% of students living onsite). RB-TPP was implemented broadly as planned but relaxed socialdistancing was terminated early due to concerns relating to national escalationof the COVID-19 Delta variant, albeit testing continued. Most students (97.9%)perceived the period of relaxed social distancing within residences positively.The majority engaged in asymptomatic testing (88%); 46% (52% of testers) werefully compliant with pre-determined testing frequency. Implementation wasfacilitated by convenience and efficiency of testing, and reduction in thenegative impacts of isolation through opportunities for students to socialise.Main barriers to implementation were perceived mixed-messages about the rules,ambivalent attitudes, and lack of adherence to COVID-19 protective measures inthe minority. CONCLUSIONS: This process evaluation identifies factors that helpor hinder the success of university residence-based outbreak prevention andmanagement strategies. RB-TPP led to increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 testingparticipation among students in university residences. Perceived normalisation ofuniversity life significantly enhanced student mental wellbeing. The complexityand challenge generated by multiple lines of communication and rapid adaptions toa changing pandemic context was evident. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UKAS307727-02-01; Pre-results.

TI  - Social consequences of COVID-19 on fertility preference consistency andcontraceptive use among Nigerian women: insights from population-based data.
PG  - 14
LID - 10.1186/s40834-022-00181-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence from high income countries showed that the COVID-19pandemic has had negative effects on population and reproductive healthbehaviour. This study provides a sub-Saharan Africa perspective by documentingthe social consequences of COVID-19 and its relationship to fertility preference stability and modern contraceptive use in Nigeria. METHOD: We analysed panel datacollected by Performance Monitoring for Action in Nigeria. Baseline and Follow-upsurveys were conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak (November 2019-February 2020)and during the lockdown respectively (May-July 2020). Analysis was restricted to married non-pregnant women during follow-up (n = 774). Descriptive statistics andgeneralized linear models were employed to explore the relationship betweenselected social consequences of COVID-19 and fertility preferences stability(between baseline and follow-up) as well as modern contraceptives use. RESULTS:Reported social consequences of the pandemic lockdown include total loss ofhousehold income (31.3%), food insecurity (16.5%), and greater economic reliance on partner (43.0%). Sixty-eight women (8.8%) changed their minds about pregnancy and this was associated with age groups, higher wealth quintile (AOR = 0.38, CI: 0.15-0.97) and household food insecurity (AOR = 2.72, CI: 1.23-5.99). Fertilitypreference was inconsistent among 26.1%. Women aged 30-34 years (AOR = 4.46,CI:1.29-15.39) were more likely of inconsistent fertility preference compared to 15-24 years. The likelihood was also higher among women with three childrencompared to those with only one child (AOR = 3.88, CI: 1.36-11.08). Duringfollow-up survey, 59.4% reported they would feel unhappy if pregnant. This wasmore common among women with tertiary education (AOR = 2.99, CI: 1.41-6.33). The odds increased with parity. The prevalence of modern contraceptive use was 32.8%.Women aged 45-49 years (AOR = 0.24, CI: 0.10-0.56) were less likely to use moderncontraceptives than those aged 15-24 years. In contrast, the odds ofcontraceptive use were significantly higher among those with three (AOR = 1.82,CI: 1.03-3.20), four (AOR = 2.45, CI: 1.36-4.39) and at least five (AOR = 2.89,CI: 1.25-6.74) children. Unhappy disposition towards pregnancy (AOR = 2.48, CI:1.724-3.58) was also a significant predictor of modern contraceptive use.CONCLUSION: Some social consequences of COVID-19 affected pregnancy intention andstability of fertility preference but showed no independent association withmodern contraceptive use.

TI  - Pasos Hacia La Salud II: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of atheory- and technology-enhanced physical activity intervention for Latina women, compared to the original intervention.
PG  - 621
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06575-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Latinas are at increased risk for many lifestyle-related chronicdiseases and are one of the least physically active populations in the USInnovative strategies are needed to help Latinas achieve the health benefitsassociated with physical activity (PA). This manuscript describes the studyprotocol of the Pasos Hacia La Salud II Study, which builds upon our previousresearch to test an enhanced individually-tailored, text-message andwebsite-delivered, Spanish-language intervention (enhanced intervention), incomparison to the original web-based Pasos Hacia La Salud Intervention (original intervention). METHODS: Sedentary Latinas between the ages of 18-65 will berecruited and will complete an orientation and baseline assessments. Participantswill be subsequently randomized to the original intervention, or the EnhancedIntervention, which has greater targeting of theoretical constructs such asself-efficacy, enjoyment, and social support, and which uses text messages andmore dynamic and refined website features to encourage increased website use.Using a linear mixed effects regression model, we will simultaneously estimatethe intervention effects on mean accelerometer-measured hours/week ofmoderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with asubject-specific intercept (intent-to-treat sample). Change in self-reportedMVPA, measured via the 7-day Physical Activity Recall, will be assessed as asecondary outcome using a similar model. We will investigate potential mediators of the intervention effect using a multiple mediation approach, and potentialmoderators by evaluating potential interactions. As an exploratory outcome, wewill study the differences (among both study arms) in cost, in US dollars, perminute increases in weekly mean MVPA. DISCUSSION: The original Pasos PAintervention showed efficacy in helping Latinas increase PA; we expect theEnhanced Intervention to help a larger proportion of participants to increase andmaintain their PA long term. This web- and text-based enhanced intervention couldhave great reach and dissemination potential, which could be capitalized on inthe future to help to advance health equity. Adaptations made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are also described in this manuscript. TRIAL REGISTRATION:Clinical Trial Number: NCT03491592 . First posted April 9, 2018.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the accompanying contactrestrictions, a new challenge arose for dental education. Despite the limitedoverall situation, it must be ensured that, in addition to theoretical content,practical skills in particular continue to be taught. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and implement an online hands-on course for dental students that ensures practical training, even during the pandemic. METHODS: The newlydeveloped course was held from April 2020 to March 2021. A total of six groups(each consisting of approximately 40-50 students) took part in the course. Theparticipating students were in their 3rd, 4th or 5th year of study. The coursetaught theoretical basics (via an online platform) and promoted the learning ofpractical/surgical techniques on models such as bananas, pork bellies, or chickenthighs with live demonstrations (via ZOOM) and interactive post-preparation bystudents at home (and in a rotating small group of 3-7 students on site). Studentself-evaluation (at the beginning and end of the course) and course evaluationwere performed using questionnaires. The learning success was analyzed (throughself-evaluations) using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (significance level alpha =0.05). RESULTS: Concerning students self-evaluations, the theoretical knowledge, general surgical skills (such as surgical instrument handling), and specificsurgical skills (such as performing a kite flap) improved during the course, withsignificant results (p < 0.001 for each). About 60% of the students rated thecourse overall as excellent (grades 9 or 10 on a Likert scale of 1 to 10). Thetechnical implementation of the course was rated with a median of 9 (= very good,on a Likert scale of 1 to 10). 38.5% described the applicability of the skillslearned for their later professional life as extremely good. CONCLUSIONS: Theresults of this work suggest that, within the limitations of this study, theintroduced concept of an online hands-on course could be an appropriate form ofteaching practical dental skills, even during a pandemic. Further research isneeded in the field of digital education for dental students.

TI  - Impact of rapid molecular testing on diagnosis, treatment and management ofcommunity-acquired pneumonia in Norway: a pragmatic randomised controlled trial(CAPNOR).
PG  - 622
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06467-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) causes a large burden of disease. Due to difficulties in obtaining representative respiratory samples andinsensitive standard microbiological methods, the microbiological aetiology ofCAP is difficult to ascertain. With a few exceptions, standard-of-carediagnostics are too slow to influence initial decisions on antimicrobial therapy.The management of CAP is therefore largely based on empirical treatmentguidelines. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is often initiated in the primary care setting, affecting diagnostic tests based on conventional bacterial culture inhospitalized patients. Implementing rapid molecular testing may improve both the proportion of positive tests and the time it takes to obtain test results. Bothmeasures are important for initiation of pathogen-targeted antibiotics, involvingrapid de-escalation or escalation of treatment, which may improve antimicrobialstewardship and potentially patient outcome. METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency department of Haukeland University Hospital (HUH) in Bergen, Norway,will be screened for inclusion into a pragmatic randomised controlled trial(RCT). Eligible patients with a suspicion of CAP will be included and randomised to receive either standard-of-care methods (standard microbiological testing) or standard-of-care methods in addition to testing by the rapid and comprehensivereal-time multiplex PCR panel, the BioFire(R) FilmArray(R) Pneumonia Panel plus(FAP plus) (bioMerieux S.A., Marcy-l'Etoile, France). The results of the FAP pluswill be communicated directly to the treating staff within ~2 h of sampling.DISCUSSION: We will examine if rapid use of FAP plus panel in hospitalizedpatients with suspected CAP can improve both the time to and the proportion ofpatients receiving pathogen-directed treatment, thereby shortening the exposureto unnecessary antibiotics and the length of hospital admission, compared to the standard-of-care arm. The pragmatic design together with broad inclusion criteriaand a straightforward intervention could make our results generalizable to other similar centres.

TI  - Spatiotemporal impacts of human activities and socio-demographics during theCOVID-19 outbreak in the US.
PG  - 1466
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13793-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding non-epidemiological factors is essential for thesurveillance and prevention of infectious diseases, and the factors are likely tovary spatially and temporally as the disease progresses. However, the impacts of these influencing factors were primarily assumed to be stationary over time andspace in the existing literature. The spatiotemporal impacts of mobility-related and social-demographic factors on disease dynamics remain to be explored.METHODS: Taking daily cases data during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)outbreak in the US as a case study, we develop a mobility-augmentedgeographically and temporally weighted regression (M-GTWR) model to quantify the spatiotemporal impacts of social-demographic factors and human activities on the COVID-19 dynamics. Different from the base GTWR model, the proposed M-GTWR model incorporates a mobility-adjusted distance weight matrix where travel mobility is used in addition to the spatial adjacency to capture the correlations among localobservations. RESULTS: The results reveal that the impacts of social-demographic and human activity variables present significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Inparticular, a 1% increase in population density may lead to 0.63% more dailycases, and a 1% increase in the mean commuting time may result in 0.22% increasesin daily cases. Although increased human activities will, in general, intensifythe disease outbreak, we report that the effects of grocery and pharmacy-related activities are insignificant in areas with high population density. Andactivities at the workplace and public transit are found to either increase ordecrease the number of cases, depending on particular locations. CONCLUSIONS:Through a mobility-augmented spatiotemporal modeling approach, we could quantify the time and space varying impacts of non-epidemiological factors on COVID-19cases. The results suggest that the effects of population density,socio-demographic attributes, and travel-related attributes will differsignificantly depending on the time of the pandemic and the underlying location. Moreover, policy restrictions on human contact are not universally effective inpreventing the spread of diseases.

PG  - 1459
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13829-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has drastically changed the everyday lives of children,including limiting interactions with peers, loss of regularly organizedactivities, and closure of schools and recreational facilities. While COVID-19protocols are in place to reduce viral transmission, they have affectedchildren's access to physical activity opportunities. The purpose of this studywas to understand how COVID-19 has affected children's engagement in physicalactivity and to identify strategies that can support children's return tophysical activity programming in public places. METHODS: Parents of pastparticipants in the Grade 5 ACT-i-Pass Program in London, Ontario, Canada wereinvited to participate in a semi-structured interview online (in November andDecember 2020) via Microsoft Teams. The script was comprised of questions abouttheir child's physical activity levels (before, current, and anticipatedfollowing COVID-19), lifestyle changes due to COVID-19, and what serviceproviders can do to assist children's return to public programming. Interviewswere transcribed in Microsoft Teams, reviewed by a member of the research team,and analyzed in NVivo 12 using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven parentsparticipated in an interview. Four themes and two subthemes were identifiedduring analysis: (1) modifications to everyday life (a. activity optionsavailable and b. altered social environment), (2) safety in public spaces, (3)accessibility of activities, and (4) utilizing outdoor spaces. CONCLUSIONS:COVID-19 protocols have decreased children's physical activity levels due to the loss of their regular activities, recreational spaces, and peer support.Implementing facility and activity-specific health protocols, providing outdooractivity options, and offering a variety of activity types, times, and locations are three strategies recommended by parents to help facilitate their children'sreturn to public recreational places. Due to the negative consequences ofphysical inactivity on children's health and well-being, service providers needto implement programming and safety protocols that support children's engagement in physical activity throughout the remainder of, and the years following, theCOVID-19 pandemic.

LID - 10.1186/s10194-022-01450-8 [doi]
AB  - Headache is among the most frequent symptoms persisting or newly developing aftercoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as part of the so-called long COVID syndrome.The knowledge on long COVID headache is still limited, however growing evidenceis defining the features of this novel condition, in particular regardingclinical characteristics, some pathophysiological mechanisms and first treatment recommendations. Long COVID headache can present in the form of worsening of apreexisting primary headache, or, more specifically, in the form of a new(intermittent or daily) headache starting during the acute infection or after adelay. It often presents together with other long COVID symptoms, most frequentlywith hyposmia. It can manifest with a migrainous or, more frequently, with atension-type-like phenotype. Persistent activation of the immune system andtrigeminovascular activation are thought to play a role. As there are virtuallyno treatment studies, treatment currently is largely guided by the existingguidelines for primary headaches with the corresponding phenotype. The presentreport, a collaborative work of the international group of the Junior EditorialBoard of The Journal of Headache and Pain aims to summarize the most recentevidence about long COVID headache and suggests approaches to the diagnosis andtreatment of this disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Migrant and refugee women have faced a myriad of challenges duringCOVID-19, which are often exacerbated by the interaction between thispopulation's diverse identities and established systems in the local context.This qualitative study uses the lens of intersectionality to understand migrantand refugee women's experiences of gender-based violence and access to andquality of support services in Italy during the first year of COVID-19. METHODS: Data were gathered from 51 key informant interviews and eight focus groupdiscussions of 31 participants. Key informants included service providers across sectors, including gender-based violence and anti-violence organizations,government and law, health, psychology, social work, and anti-traffickingadministration. Focus group participants were migrant and refugee women aged18-65 from the following countries of origin: Bangladesh, Cameroon, Colombia, El Salvador, Gambia, Ghana, Honduras, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Senegal, andSyria. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded using acollaborative process with partners from UNICEF. Transcripts were then evaluated for arising themes using three methods of intersectionality analysis. RESULTS:Data analysis revealed how COVID-19 converged with sexism, racism, and xenophobiain Italy, leading to increased public and domestic violence against refugee andmigrant women. Another prominent theme was the exacerbated vulnerability forrefugee and migrant women in precarious socioeconomic situations, which prompted many service providers to recognize and address gaps in service offerings andcoordination around basic needs. However, due to resource constraints and bias,providers did not systematically incorporate inclusive language and culturalmediation into remote and online services, creating a heightened barrier toaccess for non-Italian women despite their complex needs. As such, refugee andmigrant women highlighted community-based solidarity and support as protectivefactors during lockdown periods. CONCLUSION: Findings emphasize how overlappingdominant sociocultural and socioeconomic systems impacted refugee and migrantwomen's experiences of violence during COVID-19 in Italy, and how some supportservices were unprepared to respond to the complex needs of diverse, newcomerpopulations. We discuss how policymakers and practitioners might considerintersectionality in their preparedness and response planning for gender-basedviolence services during health emergencies moving forward.

TI  - Maintenance of the critical care system during the pandemic in non-COVID-19patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy: a single centerexperience.
PG  - 138
LID - 10.1186/s12873-022-00693-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, maintenance of essential healthcaresystems became very challenging. We describe the triage system of our institute, and assess the quality of care provided to critically ill non-COVID-19 patientsrequiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) during the pandemic.METHODS: We introduced an emergency triage pathway early in the pandemic. Weretrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who received CRRT in ourhospital from January 2016 to March 2021. We excluded end-stage kidney diseasepatients on maintenance dialysis. Patients were stratified as medical andsurgical patients. The time from hospital arrival to intensive care unit (ICU)admission, the time from hospital arrival to intervention/operation, and thein-hospital mortality rate were compared before (January 2016 to December 2019)and during (January 2021 to March 2021) the pandemic. RESULTS: The mean number ofcritically ill patients who received CRRT annually in the surgical departmentsignificantly decreased during the pandemic in (2016-2019: 76.5 +/- 3.1; 2020:56; p < 0.010). Age, sex, and the severity of disease at admission did notchange, whereas the proportions of medical patients with diabetes (before: 44.4%;after: 56.5; p < 0.005) and cancer (before: 19.4%; after: 32.3%; p < 0.001)increased during the pandemic. The time from hospital arrival to ICU admissionand the time from hospital arrival to intervention/operation did not change.During the pandemic, 59.6% of surgical patients received interventions/operationswithin 6 hours of hospital arrival. In Cox's proportional hazard modeling, thehazard ratio associated with the pandemic was 1.002 (0.778-1.292) for medicalpatients and 1.178 (0.783-1.772) for surgical patients. CONCLUSION: Our triagesystem maintained the care required by critically ill non-COVID-19 patientsundergoing CRRT at our institution.

PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s12610-022-00163-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The possible effects of COVID-19 vaccines on reproductive health and male fertility in particular have been discussed intensely by the scientificcommunity and the public since their introduction during the pandemic. On newsoutlets and social media platforms, many claims have been raised regarding thedeleterious effects of COVID-19 vaccines on sperm quality without scientificevidence. In response to this emerging conflict, we designed this study toevaluate and assess the effect of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine onmale fertility represented by the semen analysis parameters. RESULTS: Comparingthe semen parameters of the participants before and after vaccination, nostatistically significant effects on semen volume, pH or normal spermconcentration and morphology were shown. However, there were statisticallysignificant differences on total sperm motility (P = 0.05) and progressivemotility (P = 0.02). These differences are clinically insignificant given thefact that both readings before and after vaccination were within the normalranges, according to the WHO manual guidelines for the examination and processingof human semen. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNACOVID-19 vaccine has no deleterious effects on semen parameters.
