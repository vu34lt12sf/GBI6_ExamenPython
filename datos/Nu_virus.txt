TI  - Coronaviruses exploit a host cysteine-aspartic protease for replication.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05148-4 [doi]
AB  - Highly pathogenic coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(1,2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV)(3), and SARS-CoV-1(4) vary in their transmissibility andpathogenicity. However, infection by all three viruses results in substantialapoptosis in cell culture(5-7) and in patient tissues(8-10), suggesting apotential link between apoptosis and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Here we show that a cysteine-aspartic protease of the apoptosis cascade, caspase-6, serves as an important host factor for efficient coronavirus replication. We demonstratethat caspase-6 cleaves coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins, generating Nfragments that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists, thus facilitating virusreplication. Inhibition of caspase-6 substantially attenuates lung pathology and body weight loss of SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian hamsters and improves thesurvival of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoVMA)-infected human DPP4 knock-in(hDPP4 KI) mice. Overall, our study reveals how coronaviruses exploit a componentof the host apoptosis cascade to facilitate virus replication.

AB  - The pulmonary pathological findings associated with severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) result from the release of multipleproinflammatory cytokines, which causes the subsequential damage of the lungs.The current study was undertaken to investigate the responses of mast cells toviral inoculation and their contribution to host defenses from the point of view of viral entry. Pseudovirions, in which the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was incorporated, triggered activation of mast cells, and a mast cell-derivedchymase, MCP2, formed a complex with spike protein, which promotedprotease-dependent viral entry. According to the quantification results of viral entry, 10muM quercetin, a mast cell stabilizer, potentially potently inhibited41.3% of viral entry, while 100muM chymostatin, which served as a chymaseinhibitor, suppressed 52.1% of viral entry, compared to non-treated cells. Study using mast cell-deficient mice showed that the absence of mast cells mayinfluence early viral loading in the upper respiratory tract, which consequently increases the risk of viral invasion into the lower respiratory system.Furthermore, mast cell-deficient mice exhibited ongoing infection in the latephase post-viral inoculation, while clearance of virus-positive cells wasobserved in wild-type mice. In conclusion, mast cells act as a multifacetedimmune modulator that is equipped with both protective effects and pathogenicinfluences on viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. The utility of mast cell stabilizers andchymase inhibitors in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratorysyndrome should be optimized regarding the infection stage and the risk ofcytokine storm.

AB  - Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a baculovirus that infects silkworms,and its interaction with silkworm has been considered an important model in thefield of insect virology. Accumulating evidence indicates that most virusespromote glycolytic metabolism in host cells to favor infection. However, similar reports are lacking in insects, especially in the area of post-translationalmodifications of proteins. In this study, we found that BmNPV infection inducedthe acetylation of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDO) on lysine 42 (K42) topromote its enzyme activity. To explore the underlying mechanisms, site-directed mutagenesis of deacetylated mimic (K/R) was performed. The results demonstratedthat K42 acetylation promoted viral proliferation by exacerbating the glycolytic flux induced by BmNPV infection, which resulted in increased ATP, glucose uptake and lactate accumulation. Inhibiting glycolysis with 2-deoxygucose (2DG) revealedthat glycolysis was essential for optimal BmNPV infection. Finally, we showedthat BmNPV-infected cells enhanced the transcription of glycolysis-related genes,including Glut1, Hk2 and Ldh. In parallel, K42 acetylation of ALDO also promoted the expression of these genes. Therefore, acetylation of ALDO could be considereda regulator of BmNPV-induced glycolysis. These finding provide insights into the interaction between silkworm and BmNPV.

AB  - Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and red-spotted grouper nervous necrosisvirus (RGNNV) are important pathogens that cause high mortality and heavyeconomic losses in grouper aquaculture. Interestingly, SGIV infection in grouper cells induces paraptosis-like cell death, while RGNNV infection induces autophagyand necrosis characterized morphologically by vacuolation of lysosome. Here, acomparative transcriptomic analysis was carried out to identify the differentmolecular events during SGIV and RGNNV infection in grouper spleen (EAGS) cells. The functional enrichment analysis of DEGs suggested that several signalingpathways were involved in CPE progression and host immune response against SGIVor RGNNV. Most of DEGs featured in the KEGG "lysosome pathway" were up-regulated in RGNNV-infected cells, indicating that RGNNV induced lysosomal vacuolizationand autophagy might be due to the disturbance of lysosomal function. More than100 DEGs in cytoskeleton pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)signal pathway were identified during SGIV infection, providing additionalevidence for the roles of cytoskeleton remodeling in cell rounding during CPEprogression and MAPK signaling in SGIV induced cell death. Of note, consistentwith changes at the transcriptional levels, the post-translational modifications of MAPK signaling-related proteins were also detected during RGNNV infection, andthe inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPKsignificantly suppressed viral replication and virus induced vacuoles formation. Moreover, the majority of DEGs in interferon and inflammation signaling wereobviously up-regulated during RGNNV infection, but down-regulated during SGIVinfection, suggesting that SGIV and RGNNV differently manipulated host immuneresponse in vitro. In addition, purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways werealso differently regulated in SGIV and RGNNV-infection cells. Taken together, ourdata will provide new insights into understanding the potential mechanismsunderlying different host cell responses against fish DNA and RNA virus.

AB  - Autophagy impacts the replication cycle of many viruses. Grass Carp Reovirus(GCRV) is an agent that seriously affects the development of the grass carpaquaculture industry. The role of autophagy in GCRV infection is not clearlyunderstood. In this study, we identified that GCRV infection triggered autophagy in CIK cells, which was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, theconversion of LC3B I to LC3B II and the level of autophagy substrate p62.Furthermore, we found that GCRV infection activated Akt-mTOR signaling pathway,and the conversion of LC3B I to LC3B II was increased by inhibiting mTOR withrapamycin (Rap) but decreased by activating Akt with insulin. We then assessedthe effects of autophagy on GCRV replication. We found that inducing autophagywith Rap promoted GCRV proliferation but inhibiting autophagy with 3MA or CQinhibited GCRV replication in CIK cells. Moreover, it was found that enhancingAkt-mTOR activity by insulin, GCRV VP7 protein and viral titers of GCRV weredecreased. Collectively, these results indicated that GCRV infection inducedautophagy involved in GCRV replication via the Akt-mTOR signal pathway. Thus, newinsights into GCRV pathogenesis and antiviral treatment strategies are provided.

AB  - Proteins of Spatzle family play an essential role in innate immunity ininvertebrates by activating the Toll pathway to induce the expression ofantimicrobial peptides. However, little is known about the function of Spatzle inin the immune response of the Chinese mitten crab. In the present study, threenovel Spatzle genes (named as EsSpz1, EsSpz2, and EsSpz3) were identified fromEriocheir sinensis. The genome structure of EsSpz1 contains two exons and anintron. Three Spatzle proteins all contain a Pfam Spaetzle domain. In theevolution, EsSpz1-3 cluster with other Spatzle proteins from crustaceans.EsSpz1-3 were widely distributed in multiple immune tissues. The expressionlevels of EsSpz1-3 in the intestine were remarkably upregulated after white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. The knockdown of EsSpz1-3 remarkably decreasedthe expressions of crustins and anti-lipopolysaccharide factors during WSSVinfection. Moreover, EsSpz1-3 silencing remarkably increased the expression ofWSSV envelope protein VP28. These findings suggest that new-found EsSpz1-3 in E. sinensis could promote the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and inhibit theexpression of VP28 during WSSV infection. Our study indicates that EsSpz1-3 in E.sinensis may participate in the innate immune defenses against WSSV by inducingthe expression of antimicrobial peptides. This study provides new knowledge forthe function of Spatzle in the antiviral immune defense in crustacean.

AB  - Mosquitoes are a vector of human disease transmitting malaria, and manyarboviruses such as dengue virus and Zika virus. This study determined mosquitolarval occurrence and abundance in residential areas around Suratthani RajabhatUniversity as influenced by ecological factors and breeding container diversity. Mosquito larvae were collected using a standard dipping method from 95 locations during April through September 2019 and environmental factors such asphysicochemical parameters of water in the breeding containers were measured.During the survey, a total of 194 houses were inspected, of which 58 were foundto be infested with mosquito larvae, with a house index of 29.90, a containerindex of 25.55, and a Breteau index of 48.99. A total of 5,123 mosquito larvaewere reported from seven breeding habitat types namely, plastics, cement, mudpots, glass, foam, discarded tires and natural materials. Among the collectedlarvae, Aedes albopictus (56.45%) was most prevalent, while Culex sp. (22.33%)and Aedes aegypti were less prevalent (21.21%). The most common mosquito larvaebreeding habitats were plastics (44.22%) followed by discarded tires (18.14%).The spearman correlation analysis showed that the number of mosquito larvae were significantly positively correlated with the depths and width of containers(p<0.05). These findings are helpful in understanding the ecological factors and breeding habitat types that influence mosquito species and their abundance, andalso in determining ways to control mosquito borne diseases.

AB  - Capsid assembly modulators (CAMs) have recently been revealed to be effective in blocking HBV replication. HBV capsid protein inhibitors reduce and ultimatelyeliminate HBV by inhibiting virus replication and blocking hepatocyte infection. Sulfonamides are synthetic functional groups in development of different kinds ofdrugs. Sulfonyl benzamide clinical drugs NVR 3-778 and BA-38017 are leadcompounds in discovery of antiviral compounds with increased activity and reducedcytotoxicity by drug design strategies including pharmacophore hybrid,bioisosterism and scaffold hopping. In current study, three series of targetcompounds were synthesized, and their anti-HBV activity was evaluated againstHepAD38 cells. Compound 5a (EC50 = 0.50 +/- 0.07 muM, CC50 = 48.16 +/- 9.15 muM) showed better anti-HBV DNA replication activity than the lead compound BA-38017, and showed good inhibitory effect on the assembly of HBV capsid protein compared with the clinical drug NVR 3-778. In addition, preliminary structure-activityrelationship (SAR) and molecular docking studies were conducted to explorepotential interactions and binding modes between compounds and target proteins,which may help researchers to find more effective anti-HBV drugs.

AB  - Targeting the vital kinase protein TBK1, optineurin (OPTN) performs as asuppressor involved in controlling RNA virus-induced interferon beta (IFN-beta)production. It has been determined that OPTN is altered by phosphorylation andubiquitination, which are crucial for the generation of IFN-beta and mitophagy.In this study, endogenous OPTN was first discovered in human cells at a molecularmass of about 115 kD. The SUMOylation band was verified to be the highermolecular mass band of the OPTN. Additionally, the OPTN SUMOylation band was seenin cells from several species, including mouse, rabbit, bovine, porcine, etc.,but not in cells from avian animals (chicken and duck). This finding suggeststhat OPTN SUMOylation is well conserved in mammals but not in avian animals.Additionally, it was determined that some lysine residues in the human OPTN hadSUMOylation sites that followed the consensus motif. LPS, VSV infection,starvation, and RNA virus infection are a few of the stimuli that encourageendogens OPTN SUMOylation. OPTN SUMOylation is essential for OPTN biologicalactivity, as evidenced by the stark differences in the cellular distribution ofmutant OPTN SUMOylation sites from wild type (WT) OPTN. Additionally, wediscovered that non-SUMOylated OPTN lost its ability to block both IFN-betaproduction. Our findings offer a preliminary understanding of how OPTNSUMOylation regulates IFN-beta production.

AB  - Velpatasvir is a novel inhibitor of hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5Athat received US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment ofpatients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 1-6. In the present study, asensitive bioanalytical method for velpatasvir was developed usinghigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detectorsystem, which was applied to elucidate the factors determining the oralbioavailability and disposition of velpatasvir. This method offered sufficientsensitivity, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.5 ng/mL, which iscomparable to previously reported methods using liquid chromatography coupledwith tandem mass spectrometry. Velpatasvir exhibited low oral bioavailability,moderate intestinal permeability, and significant biliary excretion in rats. Itwas also found to be significantly metabolized in the liver, with alow-to-moderate extraction ratio; however, its intestinal metabolism andenterohepatic circulation did not occur. Thus, our present results demonstratethat the oral bioavailability of velpatasvir is primarily dependent on gutabsorption and hepatic first-pass metabolism. The fractions of velpatasvir doseunabsorbed from the gut and eliminated by the liver before reaching the systemic circulation following oral administration were estimated to be 32.8%-58.6% and4.74%-30.54% of the oral dose, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to investigate the contributory roles of biopharmaceutical andpharmacokinetic factors on the oral bioavailability of velpatasvir, together witha new bioanalytical method for velpatasvir.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agentof the disease COVID-19, first emerged in late December 2019 in China, and hassubsequently become a pandemic with unprecedented clinical impact. The virusappears to more severely affect older individuals and those with co-morbidmedical conditions, specifically those with chronic lung disease, obesity, heart failure and diabetes. Fortunately, children appear to be less severely affected, though mortality and severe disease have been reported. In addition, children'srole in spreading the disease (potentially through asymptomatic shedding of thevirus) remains an important area requiring further investigation. The emergenceof SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the importance of metagenomic next generationsequencing as a tool for pandemic investigation. Though no proven therapeuticoptions currently exist, ongoing genomic and clinical trial data may help inform the identification and development of both repurposed and novel therapeuticagents for use in this disease.

LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c03119 [doi]
AB  - The elucidation of viral-receptor interactions and an understanding ofvirus-spreading mechanisms are of great importance, particularly in the era of a pandemic. Indeed, advances in computational chemistry, synthetic biology, andprotein engineering have allowed precise prediction and characterization of such interactions. Nevertheless, the hazards of the infectiousness of viruses, theirrapid mutagenesis, and the need to study viral-receptor interactions in a complexin vivo setup call for further developments. Here, we show the development ofbiocompatible genetically engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) that displaythe receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 on their surface as coronavirusmimetics (EVs(RBD)). Loading EVs(RBD) with iron oxide nanoparticles makes themMRI-visible and, thus, allows mapping of the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptorsnoninvasively in live subjects. Moreover, we show that EVs(RBD) can be modifiedto display mutants of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, allowing rapid screening ofcurrently raised or predicted variants of the virus. The proposed platform thusshows relevance and cruciality in the examination of quickly evolving pathogenic viruses in an adjustable, fast, and safe manner. Relying on MRI forvisualization, the presented approach could be considered in the future to mapligand-receptor binding events in deep tissues, which are not accessible toluminescence-based imaging.

Tight regulation of the GC is essential due to the inherent risks of tumorigenesis and autoimmunity posed byinappropriate GC B cell processes. Gammaherpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) utilize numerous armaments to drive infected naive B cells, independent of antigen, through GC reactions to expandthe latently infected B cell population and establish a stable latency reservoir.We previously demonstrated that the MHV68 microRNA (miRNA) mghv-miR-M1-7-5prepresses host EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1) to promote B cellinfection. EWSR1 is a transcription and splicing regulator that is recognized forits involvement as a fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma. A function for EWSR1 in Bcell responses has not been previously reported. Here, we demonstrate that 1) Bcell-specific deletion of EWSR1 had no effect on generation of mature B cellsubsets or basal immunoglobulin levels in naive mice, 2) repression or ablationof EWSR1 in B cells promoted expansion of MHV68 latently infected GC B cells, and3) B cell-specific deletion of EWSR1 during a normal immune response to nonviral antigen resulted in significantly elevated numbers of antigen-specific GC Bcells, plasma cells, and circulating antibodies. Notably, EWSR1 deficiency didnot affect the proliferation or survival of GC B cells but instead resulted inthe generation of increased numbers of precursor GC B cells. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that EWSR1 is a negative regulator of B cell responses.

PG  - e0010305
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The simultaneous infection of Plasmodium falciparum and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) could promote the development of the aggressive endemic Burkitt'sLymphoma (eBL) in children living in P. falciparum holoendemic areas. While it iswell-established that eBL is not related to other human malaria parasites, theimpact of EBV infection on the generation of human malaria immunity remainslargely unexplored. Considering that this highly prevalent herpesvirusestablishes a lifelong persistent infection on B-cells with possible influence onmalaria immunity, we hypothesized that EBV co-infection could have impact on the naturally acquired antibody responses to P. vivax, the most widespread humanmalaria parasite. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study design involved threecross-sectional surveys at six-month intervals (baseline, 6 and 12 months) among long-term P. vivax exposed individuals living in the Amazon rainforest. Theapproach focused on a group of malaria-exposed individuals whose EBV-DNA(amplification of balf-5 gene) was persistently detected in the peripheral blood (PersVDNA, n = 27), and an age-matched malaria-exposed group whose EBV-DNA could never be detected during the follow-up (NegVDNA, n = 29). During the follow-upperiod, the serological detection of EBV antibodies to lytic/ latent viralantigens showed that IgG antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA-p18) weresignificantly different between groups (PersVDNA > NegVDNA). A panel ofblood-stage P. vivax antigens covering a wide range of immunogenicity confirmedthat in general PersVDNA group showed low levels of antibodies as compared withNegVDNA. Interestingly, more significant differences were observed to a novelDBPII immunogen, named DEKnull-2, which has been associated with long-termneutralizing antibody response. Differences between groups were less pronouncedwith blood-stage antigens (such as MSP1-19) whose levels can fluctuate according to malaria transmission. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In a proof-of-concept study weprovide evidence that a persistent detection of EBV-DNA in peripheral blood ofadults in a P. vivax semi-immune population may impact the long-term immuneresponse to major malaria vaccine candidates.

TI  - Prevalence of respiratory viruses among paediatric patients in acute respiratory illnesses in Malaysia.
PG  - e0265288
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0265288 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, there is limitedsurveillance data on the epidemiological burden of respiratory pathogens intropical countries like Malaysia. This study aims to estimate the prevalence ofrespiratory pathogens causing ARIs among children aged <18 years old in Malaysia and their epidemiological characteristics. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimensreceived at 12 laboratories located in different states of Malaysia from2015-2019 were studied. Detection of 18 respiratory pathogens were performedusing multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Data from a total of 23,306 paediatric patients whopresented with ARI over a five-year period was studied. Of these, 18538 (79.5%)were tested positive. The most prevalent respiratory pathogens detected in thisstudy were enterovirus/ rhinovirus (6837/ 23000; 29.7%), influenza virus (5176/23000; 22.5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3652/ 23000; 15.9%).Throughout the study period, RSV demonstrated the most pronounce seasonality;peak infection occurred during July to September. Whereas the influenza virus wasdetected year-round in Malaysia. No seasonal variation was noted in otherrespiratory pathogens. The risk of RSV hospitalisation was found to besignificantly higher in children aged less than two years old, whereashospitalisation rates for the influenza virus peaked at children aged between 3-6years old. CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into the epidemiology and the seasonality of the causative pathogens of ARI among the paediatric population in Malaysia. Knowledge of seasonal respiratory pathogens epidemiological dynamicswill facilitate the identification of a target window for vaccination.

TI  - Diagnostic Approaches For COVID-19: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c01697 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a transmitted respiratory disease causedby the infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). Although humankind has experienced several outbreaks of infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic has the highest rate of infection and has hadhigh levels of social and economic repercussions. The current COVID-19 pandemichas highlighted the limitations of existing virological tests, which have failed to be adopted at a rate to properly slow the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Pandemicpreparedness has developed as a focus of many governments around the world in theevent of a future outbreak. Despite the largely widespread availability ofvaccines, the importance of testing has not diminished to monitor the evolutionof the virus and the resulting stages of the pandemic. Therefore, developingdiagnostic technology that serves as a line of defense has become imperative. In particular, that test should satisfy three criteria to be widely adopted:simplicity, economic feasibility, and accessibility. At the heart of it all, itmust enable early diagnosis in the course of infection to reduce spread. However,diagnostic manufacturers need guidance on the optimal characteristics of avirological test to ensure pandemic preparedness and to aid in the effectivetreatment of viral infections. Nanomaterials are a decisive element in developingCOVID-19 diagnostic kits as well as a key contributor to enhance the performance of existing tests. Our objective is to develop a profile of the criteria thatshould be available in a platform as the target product. In this work, virusdetection tests were evaluated from the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic, andthen we generalized the requirements to develop a target product profile for aplatform for virus detection.

AB  - Developing numerous nanotechnological designed tools to monitor the existence of SARS-CoV-2, and modifying its interactions address the global needs for efficientremedies required for the management of COVID-19. Herein, through amultidisciplinary outlook encompassing different fields such as thepathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, analysis of symptoms, and statistics ofneurological complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central andperipheral nervous systems have been testified. The anosmia (51.1%) and ageusia(45.5%) are reported the most frequent neurological manifestation.Cerebrovascular disease and encephalopathy were mainly related to severe clinicalcases. In addition, we focus especially on the various concerned physiologicalroutes, including BBB dysfunction, which transpired due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, direct and indirect effects of the virus on the brain, and also, the plausiblemechanisms of viral entry to the nerve system. We also outline thecharacterization, and the ongoing pharmaceutical applications of quantum dots as smart nanocarriers crossing the blood-brain barrier and their importance inneurological diseases, mainly SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations Moreover, themarket status, six clinical trials recruiting quantum dots, and the challengeslimiting the clinical application of QDs are highlighted.

TI  - Inhibition of dengue virus infection by trifluoperazine.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05555-y [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, isthe most widespread viral pathogen transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Despitethe increased incidence of DENV infection, there are no antiviral drugs availablefor treatment or prevention. Phenothiazines are heterocyclic compounds withvarious pharmacological properties that are very adaptable for drug repurposing. In the present report, we analyzed the antiviral activity against DENV and therelated Zika virus (ZIKV) of trifluoperazine (TFP), a phenothiazine derivative inclinical use as an antipsychotic and antiemetic agent. TFP exhibiteddose-dependent inhibitory activity against the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV inmonkey Vero cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations with 50% effectiveconcentration values in the range 1.6-6.4 microM. A similar level of antiviralefficacy was exhibited by TFP against flavivirus infection in the human celllines A549 and HepG2. Mechanistic studies, performed using time-dependentinfectivity assays, real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescencetechniques, indicated that uncoating of the virus during penetration into thecell was the main target for TFP in infected cells, but the compound also exerteda minor effect on a late stage of the virus multiplication cycle. This studydemonstrates that TFP, a pharmacologically active phenothiazine, is a selectiveinhibitor of DENV multiplication in cell culture. Our findings open perspectives for the repositioning of phenothiazines like TFP with a wide spectrum ofantiviral efficacy as potential agents for the control of pathogenicflaviviruses.

TI  - Complete genome sequence of virulent genotype I African swine fever virus strain K49 from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, isolated from a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus).
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05543-2 [doi]
AB  - African swine fever is one of the most feared infectious diseases in the pigindustry. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an enveloped, cytoplasmicdouble-stranded DNA virus and the only member of the family Asfarviridae.Although ASFV is known to have been circulating on the African continent since atleast 1921, little is known about the genetic characteristics of historical ASFV strains isolated in sub-Saharan Africa. The few complete ASFV genome sequencesobtained from African historical isolates have demonstrated genetic diversity,but the available data are limited and insufficient for fully understanding themolecular evolution and continental spread of ASFV. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the virulent ASFV strain K49, collected during an outbreak in the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1949. Thecomplete genome sequence of ASFV strain K49 was determined using an IlluminaHiSeq platform and is 189,523 bp in length with a mean GC content of 38.43%, with189 genes annotated. This is the first reported complete genome sequence of anASFV serogroup 2 isolate. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated genetic divergencewithin genotype I, and strain K49 formed a separate branch from other ASFVgenotype I isolates.

TI  - Rapid emergence of a PB2 D701N substitution during adaptation of an H9N2 avianinfluenza virus in mice.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05536-1 [doi]
AB  - H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been isolated frequently from multipleavian species and, occasionally, from humans. To explore the potential molecular basis of cross-species transmission of H9N2 AIVs, an H9N2 AIV(A/chicken/Zhejiang/221/2016) was serially passaged in mouse lung. The resultsshowed that the mouse-adapted H9N2 virus exhibited higher virulence andreplicated more efficiently in mouse lung and liver. Whole-genome sequencingshowed an amino acid substitution, D701N, in the PB2 protein, which is likelyassociated with the increased replicative ability of H9N2 virus in mice. Therapid emergence of adaptive substitutions indicates the necessity of continuousmonitoring of H9N2 virus in poultry.

TI  - Complete genome sequence of a putative novel cytorhabdovirus isolated fromRudbeckia sp.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05556-x [doi]
AB  - Through high-throughput RNA sequencing, we discovered a putative newcytorhabdovirus in the seeds of Rudbeckia sp., which we have tentatively named"rudbeckia virus 1" (RudV1). Its complete 12,502-nt genomic sequence containsfive open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 (putative nucleocapsid protein, N), ORF2(putative phosphoprotein, P), ORF3 (putative cell-to-cell movement protein, P3), ORF4 (putative matrix protein, M), and ORF5 (putative RNA-dependent RNApolymerase, L). BLASTp searches showed that ORF1, ORF3, ORF4, and ORF5 of RudV1are most closely related to the corresponding proteins of Tagetes erecta virus 1 (a putative member of the genus Cytorhabdovirus) with 33.87% (88% querycoverage), 55.98% (89% query coverage), 35.33% (94% query coverage), and 57.75%(98% query coverage) sequence identity at the amino acid level, respectively.Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparisons indicated that RudV1 is a novelmember of the genus Cytorhabdovirus within the family Rhabdoviridae.

TI  - An overview on in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of lactoferrin: itsefficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
LID - 10.1007/s10534-022-00427-z [doi]
AB  - Beyond the absolute and indisputable relevance and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2vaccines, the rapid transmission, the severity of infection, the absence of theprotection on immunocompromised patients, the propagation of variants, the onset of infection and/or disease in vaccinated subjects and the lack of availabilityof worldwide vaccination require additional antiviral treatments. Since 1987,lactoferrin (Lf) is well-known to possess an antiviral activity related to itsphysico-chemical properties and to its ability to bind to both heparan sulfateproteoglycans (HSPGs) of host cells and/or surface components of viral particles.In the present review, we summarize in vitro and in vivo studies concerning theefficacy of Lf against DNA, RNA, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Recentstudies have revealed that the in vitro antiviral activity of Lf is alsoextendable to SARS-CoV-2. In vivo, Lf oral administration in early stage ofSARS-CoV-2 infection counteracts COVID-19 pathogenesis. In particular, the effectof Lf on SARS-CoV-2 entry, inflammatory homeostasis, iron dysregulation,iron-proteins synthesis, reactive oxygen formation, oxidative stress, gut-lungaxis regulation as well as on RNA negativization, and coagulation/fibrinolysisbalance will be critically reviewed. Moreover, the molecular mechanismsunderneath, including the Lf binding to HSPGs and spike glycoprotein, will bedisclosed and discussed. Taken together, present data not only support theapplication of the oral administration of Lf alone in asymptomatic COVID-19patients or as adjuvant of standard of care practice in symptomatic ones but alsoconstitute the basis for enriching the limited literature on Lf effectiveness forCOVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in ex vivo cultured cornea andcornea-derived epithelial cells.
LID - 10.1007/s00417-022-05776-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human corneal cells andtissues under standard corneal culture conditions using explants of COVID-19donors and primary cornea-derived epithelial cells. METHODS: Cornea isolated fromdeceased COVID-19 donors was cultured for 4 weeks, and SARS-CoV-2 replication wasmonitored by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, primary corneal epithelial cells from healthy donors were cultured ex vivo and infected with SARS-CoV-2 and humancytomegalovirus (HCMV) as a control. Infection status was assessed by westernblotting and reporter gene expression using green fluorescent protein-expressing viral strains. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor expression levels in cornea andepithelial cells were assessed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 replication in 10 corneas isolated from deceased COVID-19 patients and culturedfor 4 weeks, indicating absence of infection under natural conditions.Furthermore, high-titer SARS-CoV-2 infection of ex vivo cultured cornea-derivedepithelial cells did not result in productive virus replication. In contrast, thesame cells were highly permissive for HCMV. This phenotype could potentially beexplained by low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcriptional activity in cornea andcornea-derived epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that cornea andlimbal epithelial cells are refractory to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thiscould be due to the absence of robust receptor expression levels necessary forviral entry. This study adds further evidence to support the very low possibilityof transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected corneal transplant donor to arecipient in corneal organ cultures.

TI  - Early-onset fulminant neonatal sepsis caused by Multi-Drug Resistant and ESBLproducing E. coli (CTX-M gene) in a late-preterm neonate: case report andliterature review.
PG  - 223-226
AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a systemic condition characterized by haemodynamic changes andother clinical manifestations due to a presence of pathogenic microorganisms(bacteria, viruses, or fungi) in nor- mally sterile fluid that occurs in aninfant younger than 90 days old. Neonatal sepsis may be divided into two types:early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) and late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS).Gram-posi- tive microorganisms are the etiological agents in 62% of EOS, and in43% of the total the identified microorganism is GBS. Gram-negativemicroorganisms comprise 37% of the etiological agents of EOS, of which 29% arecaused by Escherichia coli. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae represent a majorworldwide threat among drug-resistant bacteria in both hospital and communitysettings. ESBLs are often located on large plasmids that also harbour genesresistant to other antimicrobial classes, resulting in multidrug-resistantisolates. Plasmid-encoded ESBLs of the CTX-M-type are increasingly reportedworldwide in Gram-negative rods and now account for most of the ESBLs found inEnterobacteriaceae. We present one case of EOS by Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) and ESBL producing E. coli (CTX-M gene) in a neonate born to a mother recentlyimmigrated from Africa. Maternal blood culture grew the same bacteria.

TI  - Hepatitis D (DELTA).
PG  - 149-154
AB  - The hepatitis D virus (HDV) is unique in animal virology. It is the smallest ofhuman pathogens, re- quires the HBsAg capsid of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) toassembly into infectious virions, and parasitizes the transcriptional machineryof the host. Hepatitis D is ubiquitous but prevalence varies throughout theworld. It is the most severe form of chronic viral liver disorder. Vaccinationagainst the HBV has decreased the circulation of HDV in industrialized countries but Hepatitis D remains a significant medical issue in many areas of thedeveloping world.

TI  - Genomic evidence for global ocean plankton biogeography shaped by large-scalecurrent systems.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.78129 [doi]
LID - e78129 [pii]
AB  - Biogeographical studies have traditionally focused on readily visible organisms, but recent technological advances are enabling analyses of the large-scaledistribution of microscopic organisms, whose biogeographical patterns have longbeen debated. Here we assessed the global structure of plankton geography and itsrelation to the biological, chemical, and physical context of the ocean (the'seascape') by analyzing metagenomes of plankton communities sampled acrossoceans during the Tara Oceans expedition, in light of environmental data andocean current transport. Using a consistent approach across organismal sizes thatprovides unprecedented resolution to measure changes in genomic compositionbetween communities, we report a pan-ocean, size-dependent plankton biogeography overlying regional heterogeneity. We found robust evidence for a basin-scaleimpact of transport by ocean currents on plankton biogeography, and on acharacteristic timescale of community dynamics going beyond simple seasonality orlife history transitions of plankton.

OAB - Oceans are brimming with life invisible to our eyes, a myriad of species ofbacteria, viruses and other microscopic organisms essential for the health of theplanet. These 'marine plankton' are unable to swim against currents and shouldtherefore be constantly on the move, yet previous studies have suggested thatdistinct species of plankton may in fact inhabit different oceanic regions.However, proving this theory has been challenging; collecting plankton islogistically difficult, and it is often impossible to distinguish between speciessimply by examining them under a microscope. However, within the last decade, aresearch schooner called Tara has travelled the globe to gather thousands ofplankton samples. At the same time, advances in genomics have made it possible toidentify species based only on fragments of their DNA sequence. To understand thehidden geography of plankton communities in Earth's oceans, Richter et al. pored over DNA from the Tara Oceans expedition. This revealed that, despite beingunable to resist the flow of water, various planktonic species which live closeto the surface manage to occupy distinct, stable provinces shaped by currents.Different sizes of plankton are distributed in different sized provinces, withthe smallest organisms tending to inhabit the smallest areas. Comparing DNAsimilarities and speeds of currents at the ocean surface revealed how these mightstretch and mix plankton communities. Plankton play a critical role in the healthof the ocean and the chemical cycles of planet Earth. These results could allowdeeper investigation by marine modellers, ecologists, and evolutionarybiologists. Meanwhile, work is already underway to investigate how climate changemight impact this hidden geography.

LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac509 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Bacteriophages/Phages are the viruses that infect and replicatewithin bacteria and archaea. Phages are used to therapeutically provide anotherpotential solution for solving antibiotic resistance, which is one of the threatsto global health. To develop phage therapies, the identification of phages frommetagenome sequences is the first step. Currently, there are two main methods foridentifying phages: database-based (alignment-based) methods and alignment-freemethods. Database-based methods typically use a large number of sequences asreferences; alignment-free methods usually learn the features of the sequenceswith machine learning and deep learning models. RESULTS: We propose INHERIT whichuse a deep representation learning model to integrate both database-based andalignment-free methods, combining the strengths of both. Pre-training is used as an alternative way of acquiring knowledge representations from existingdatabases, while the BERT-style deep learning framework retains the advantage of alignment-free methods. We compare INHERIT with four existing methods on athird-party benchmark dataset. Our experiments show that INHERIT achieves abetter performance with the F1-score of 0.9932. In addition, we find thatpre-training two species separately helps the non-alignment deep learning modelmake more accurate predictions. AVAILABILITY: The codes of INHERIT are nowavailable in: https://github.com/Celestial-Bai/INHERIT. SUPPLEMENTARYINFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1080/10550887.2022.2088978 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In people with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, viraleradication is associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL).OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in HRQOL among participants receiving opioid agonisttherapy undergoing treatment for HCV infection. METHODS: COSTAR (NCT02251990) wasa randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Adults with HCV infectionon opioid agonist therapy received elbasvir (50 mg)/grazoprevir (100 mg) orplacebo for 12 weeks. HRQOL was evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) Acute Form. Participantsremained blinded until 4 weeks after end of treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 201participants received elbasvir/grazoprevir and 100 participants received placebo.Treatment difference mean change from baseline scores (elbasvir/grazoprevir minusplacebo) indicated an improvement in HRQOL at 4 weeks after end of treatment inparticipants receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir versus those receiving placebo,driven by declining HRQOL in those receiving placebo and improved HRQOL incertain domains among participants receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir. Notabledifferences in SF-36v2 scores were evident in the general health (mean treatment difference [MTD], 6.00; 95% CI, 1.37-10.63), vitality (MTD, 6.81; 95% CI,1.88-11.75), and mental health (MTD, 5.17; 95% CI, 0.52-9.82) domains and in the mental component summary score (mean, 2.83; 95% CI, 0.29-5.37). No notablebetween-treatment differences were evident at treatment weeks 4 or 12.CONCLUSION: HRQOL in patients receiving medication for opioid dependence wasimproved following treatment for HCV infection with elbasvir/grazoprevir,suggesting that eradication of HCV infection with direct-acting antivirals isassociated with improved HRQOL.

TI  - Trust in healthcare providers among Chinese immigrants living with hepatitis Bvirus in Australia: A qualitative study.
LID - 10.1111/jvh.13736 [doi]
AB  - Despite the importance of trust in healthcare settings, there remains a paucityof evidence on the role it plays in patient-provider relationships and healthcareoutcomes among people living with hepatitis B virus (HBV). International evidencesuggests that Chinese immigrants living with HBV experience inequitable access,outcomes and treatment quality in CHB healthcare. This study explores individual trust in healthcare providers and its impact on health-seeking behaviours andhealth outcomes among Chinese people living with HBV in Australia. A total ofsixteen participants were recruited from the Chinese community in Sydney andMelbourne and participated in semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed within a conceptual model of trust that contains five dimensions: fidelity,competence, honesty, confidentiality and global trust. The data shows how trustin physicians was formed and influenced by factors including patient-providerinteractions, historically relevant experiences, health and illness beliefs andsystemic barriers. While the research confirms prior findings on the impact oftrust and mistrust, showing an association between low trust and treatmentnonadherence, it also generates fresh insights by examining what leads tomistrust and the role of trust in shaping participants' healthcare outcomes.Findings suggest that by treating patients with respect and dignity, improvinginterpersonal skills and cultural competency, having open discussion oncomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment and protecting privateinformation, physicians can increase patients' trust. The findings willcontribute to efforts to address HBV as a health priority and increase patients' trust in healthcare providers among Chinese immigrants living with HBV.

TI  - Estimating the potential to prevent locally acquired HIV infections in a UNAIDSFast-Track City, Amsterdam.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.76487 [doi]
LID - e76487 [pii]
AB  - Background: More than 300 cities including the city of Amsterdam in theNetherlands have joined the UNAIDS Fast-Track Cities initiative, committing toaccelerate their HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic in cities by 2030. Tosupport this commitment, we aimed to estimate the number and proportion ofAmsterdam HIV infections that originated within the city, from Amsterdamresidents. We also aimed to estimate the proportion of recent HIV infectionsduring the 5-year period 2014-2018 in Amsterdam that remained undiagnosed.Methods: We located diagnosed HIV infections in Amsterdam using postcode data(PC4) at time of registration in the ATHENA observational HIV cohort, and usedHIV sequence data to reconstruct phylogeographically distinct, partially observedAmsterdam transmission chains. Individual-level infection times were estimatedfrom biomarker data, and used to date the phylogenetically observed transmission chains as well as to estimate undiagnosed proportions among recent infections. A Bayesian Negative Binomial branching process model was used to estimate thenumber, size and growth of the unobserved Amsterdam transmission chains from the partially observed phylogenetic data. Results: Between January 1 2014 and May 12019, there were 846 HIV diagnoses in Amsterdam residents, of whom 516 (61%) wereestimated to have been infected in 2014-2018. The rate of new Amsterdam diagnosessince 2014 (104 per 100,000) remained higher than the national rates excludingAmsterdam (24 per 100,000), and in this sense Amsterdam remained a HIV hotspot inthe Netherlands. An estimated 14% [12-16%] of infections in Amsterdan MSM in2014-2018 remained undiagnosed by May 1 2019, and 41% [35-48%] in Amsterdamheterosexuals, with variation by region of birth. An estimated 68% [61-74%] ofAmsterdam MSM infections in 2014-2018 had an Amsterdam resident as source, and57% [41-71%] in Amsterdam heterosexuals, with heterogeneity by region of birth.Of the locally acquired infections, an estimated 43% [37-49%] were inforeign-born MSM, 41% [35-47%] in Dutch-born MSM, 10% [6-18%] in foreign-bornheterosexuals, and 5% [2-9%] in Dutch-born heterosexuals. We estimate themajority of Amsterdam MSM infections in 2014-2018 originated in transmissionchains that pre-existed by 2014. Conclusions: This combined phylogenetic,epidemiologic, and modelling analysis in the UNAIDS Fast-Track City Amsterdamindicates that there remains considerable potential to prevent HIV infectionsamong Amsterdam residents through city-level interventions. The burden of locallyacquired infection remains concentrated in MSM, and both Dutch-born andforeign-born MSM would likely benefit most from intensified city-levelinterventions.

TI  - Proteomic Profiling of Hypoplastic Lungs Suggests an Underlying InflammatoryResponse in the Pathogenesis of Abnormal Lung Development in CongenitalDiaphragmatic Hernia.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005656 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of lung hypoplasia in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), acommon birth defect, is poorly understood. The diaphragmatic defect can berepaired surgically, but the abnormal lung development contributes to a highmortality in these patients. To understand the underlying pathobiology, wecompared the proteomic profiles of fetal rat lungs at the alveolar stage (E21)that were either exposed to nitrofen in utero (CDH lungs, n=5) or exposed tovehicle only (non-CDH control lungs, n=5). Pathway analysis of proteomic datasetsshowed significant enrichment in inflammatory response proteins associated withcytokine signaling and Epstein Barr Virus in nitrofen CDH lungs. Amongst the 218 significantly altered proteins between CDH and non-CDH control lungs wereTenascin C, CREBBP, LYN and STAT3. We showed that Tenascin C was decreased aroundthe distal airway branches in nitrofen rat lungs and human CDH lungs, obtainedfrom stillborn fetuses that did not receive pre- or postnatal treatment. Incontrast, STAT3 was significantly increased in the airway epithelium of nitrofen lungs at E21. STAT3 inhibition after direct nitrofen exposure to fetal rat lungexplants (E14.5) partially rescued the hypoplastic lung phenotype ex vivo byincreasing peripheral lung budding. Moreover, we demonstrated that several STAT3 associated cytokines (IL-15, IL-9, IL-2) are increased in fetal trachealaspirates of CDH survivors compared to non-survivors after fetoscopic endoluminaltracheal occlusion. With our unbiased proteomics approach, we showed for thefirst time that downstream inflammatory processes are likely involved in thepathogenesis of abnormal lung development in CDH.

TI  - SLIDE: Saliva-Based SARS-CoV-2 Self-Testing with RT-LAMP in a Mobile Device.
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c01023 [doi]
AB  - Regular, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive self-testing for severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed to quellpandemic propagation. The existing at-home nucleic acid testing (NAT) test hashigh sensitivity and specificity, but it requires users to mail the sample to thecentral lab, which often takes 3-5 days to obtain the results. On the other hand,rapid antigen tests for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen provide a fast sample to answerthe test (15 min). However, the sensitivity of antigen tests is 30 to 40% lowerthan nucleic acid testing, which could miss a significant portion of infectedpatients. Here, we developed a fully integrated SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) device using a self-collectedsaliva sample. This platform can automatically handle the complexity and canperform the functions, including (1) virus particles' thermal lysis preparation, (2) sample dispensing, (3) target sequence RT-LAMP amplification, (4) real-timedetection, and (5) result report and communication. With a turnaround time ofless than 45 min, our device achieved the limit of detection (LoD) of 5copies/muL of the saliva sample, which is comparable with the LoD (6 copies/muL) using FDA-approved quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)assays with the same heat-lysis saliva sample preparation method. With clinicalsamples, our platform showed a good agreement with the results from thegold-standard RT-PCR method. These results show that our platform can performself-administrated SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing by laypersons with noninvasivesaliva samples. We believe that our self-testing platform will have an ongoingbenefit for COVID-19 control and fighting future pandemics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Respiratory Syndromes Surveillance System was created by theBrazilian Ministry of Health in 2000 to monitor influenza in this country. Withthe emergence of the new coronavirus pandemic, it became incorporated into thesurveillance network for influenza and other respiratory viruses. OBJECTIVE: Toanalyze the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the state of Acre through its hierarchical urbannetwork. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, descriptive and ecological study,using a spatiotemporal approach and using secondary data. This study wasconducted in the state of Acre, northern Brazil. METHODS: This study usedsecondary data, and epidemiological weeks and municipalities were taken to be theunits of analysis. Incidence rates and kernel intensities were calculated forfour study periods. Spatiotemporal analysis was performed using scan statisticsto identify clusters of SARS cases and considering the population of eachmunicipality. RESULTS: In general, it could be observed that there were higherkernel rates and intensities in municipalities located in the north and south of this state (i.e. its most populous municipalities). CONCLUSION: Priority areasfor interventions to control transmission of COVID-19 were highlighted, with the aim of reducing the risks of transmission to more distant areas in the urbanhierarchy of the state of Acre.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During childhood and adolescence, there are significant increases in bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD). OBJECTIVE: Toinvestigate physical growth parameters associated with BMD and BMC among childrenand adolescents diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). DESIGN ANDSETTING: Cross-sectional study conducted in Florianopolis, Brazil, among 63children and adolescents (aged 8-15 years) diagnosed with HIV. METHOD: BMD, BMCand fat percentage z score were evaluated using dual X-ray absorptiometry.Age/height z score and body mass index (BMI)/age z score were obtained inaccordance with international recommendations, and bone age was obtained through hand-wrist radiography. Sex, family income, information on HIV infection (T CD4+ lymphocyte count, viral load and type of antiretroviral therapy,moderate-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior) were used asadjustment variables in the analyses. Simple and multiple linear regressionanalyses were performed, with a significance level of P </= 0.05. RESULTS:Subtotal BMD (without the head region) was directly associated with bone age,BMI/age z score and fat percentage z score, even after adjusting for covariates. Subtotal BMC/height was directly associated with bone age, height/age z score,BMI/age z score and fat percentage z score, even after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION: Subtotal BMD and subtotal BMC/height were directly associated withphysical growth indicators among children and adolescents diagnosed with HIV.

TI  - Ten-Year Trends of Hepatitis A Seroprevalence in People Living with HIV in Korea.
LID - 10.3947/ic.2022.0062 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological information on hepatitis A among people living with HIV (PLHIV)in Korea is scarce. This retrospective study was performed at a tertiary carehospital and included 756 PLHIV with anti- hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgG tests.Between 2012 and 2021, the age at anti-HAV IgG seroconversion is graduallydelayed, and the proportion of individuals susceptible to HAV infection increasedamong adult PLHIV in Korea. The independent risk factors for HAV seropositivitywere female sex and HBs antigen (Ag) positivity. Therefore, HAV vaccination ishighly recommended for young PLHIV, especially for women or HBsAg-positiveindividuals.

LID - 10.3947/ic.2022.0063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explored the relationship between integrase strandtransfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based anti-retroviral agents and weight gain overtime, and the risk factors for weight gain in Korean people living with humanimmunodeficiency virus (PLWH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conductedretrospectively in PLWHs 18 years of age or older who took one of threeINSTI-based single-tablet regimens (STRs) (tenofovir disoproxilfumarate/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat [TDF/F/EVG/c], tenofoviralafenamide/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat [TAF/F/EVG/c], andabacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir [ABC/3TC/DTG]) for more than 2 years at threeuniversity-affiliated hospitals in South Korea from May 2014 to December 2020.Analysis was performed in the treatment-naive and treatment-experienced groups,respectively. RESULTS: Individual INSTI-based STRs were associated with weightgain at the 24-month follow up in both treatment-naive (n = 179) andtreatment-experienced (n = 290) groups. Body mass index (BMI) categories changed over time for TAF/F/EVG/c and ABC/3TC/DTG, with significant increases in therates of overweight and obesity in treatment-naive patients, whereas there was nochange for TDF/F/EVG/c. TAF/F/EVG/c significantly increased total cholesterol(TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) comparedto other regimens over 24 months. In the treatment-naive group, a baseline CD4(+)T cell count <100 cells/mm(3), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load (VL)>/=100,000 copies/mL, no physical exercise, and TAF/F/EVG/c (vs. TDF/F/EVF/c)were risk factors for >/=10% weight gain. In the treatment-experienced group, age<45 years, BMI <25 kg/m(2), and no physical exercise were risk factors for >/=5% weight gain. CONCLUSION: INSTI-based STR continued to increase body weight at the24-month follow up in treated and untreated Korean PLWH. Exercise, together with demographic-, HIV-, and anti-retroviral therapy-related factors, influencedweight gain. Therefore, when prescribing an INSTI-based STR, weight gain andmetabolic changes should be closely monitored in PLWH with these risk factors.

TI  - Comparison of Three Cardiovascular Risk Scores among HIV-Infected Patients inKorea: The Korea HIV/AIDS Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3947/ic.2022.0048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk factors for CVD,and applicability of the three known CVD risk equations in the Korean humanimmunodeficiency virus/ Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) cohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study parcitipants were HIV-infected patients in aKorean HIV/AIDS cohort enrolled from 19 hospitals between 2006 and 2017. Datacollected at entry to the cohort were analyzed. The 5-year CVD risk in eachparticipant was calculated using three CVD risk equations: reduced CVD predictionmodel of HIV-specific data collection on adverse effects of anti-HIV drugs(R-DAD), Framingham general CVD risk score (FRS), and Korean Coronary HeartDisease Risk Score (KRS). RESULTS: CVD events were observed in 11 of 586HIV-infected patients during a 5-year (median) follow-up period. The incidence ofCVD was 4.11 per 1,000 person-years. Older age (64 vs. 41 years, P = 0.005) anddiabetes mellitus (45.5% vs. 6.4%, P <0.001) were more frequent in patients with CVD. Using R-DAD, FRS, and KRS, 1.9%, 2.4%, and 0.7% of patients, respectively,were considered to have a very high risk (>/=10%) of 5-year CVD. Thediscriminatory capacities of the three prediction models were good, withc-statistic values of 0.829 (P <0.001) for R-DAD, 0.824 (P <0.001) for FRS, and0.850 (P = 0.001) for KRS. CONCLUSION: The FRS, R-DAD, and KRS performed well in the Korean HIV/AIDS cohort. A larger cohort and a longer period of follow-up may be necessary to demonstrate the risk factors and develop an independent CVD risk prediction model specific to Korean patients with HIV.

TI  - Aromatic disulfides as potential inhibitors against interaction between deaminaseAPOBEC3G and HIV infectivity factor.
PG  - 725-735
LID - 10.3724/abbs.2022049 [doi]
AB  - APOBEC3G (A3G) is a member of cytosine deaminase family with a variety of innate immune functions. It displays activities against retrovirus and retrotransposonby inhibition of virus infectivity factor (Vif)-deficient HIV-1 replication. The interaction between A3G N-terminal domain and Vif directs the cellular Cullin 5E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to ubiquitinate A3G, and leads to A3G proteasomaldegradation, which is a potential target for anti-HIV drug. Currently, there are very few reports about stable small molecules targeting the interaction betweenA3G and Vif. In this study, we screened two series of small molecules containing carbamyl sulfamide bond or disulfide bond as bridges of two different aromaticrings. Five asymmetrical disulfides were successfully identified againstinteraction between A3G and Vif with the IC 50 values close to or smaller than 1 muM, especially, not through covalently binding with A3G or Vif. They restore theA3G expression in the presence of Vif by inhibiting Vif-induced A3Gubiquitination and degradation. This study opens a way to the discovery of newanti-HIV drugs.

TI  - Targeting PIM2 by JP11646 results in significant antitumor effects in solidtumors.
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2022.5404 [doi]
LID - 114 [pii]
AB  - Proviral integration of Moloney virus 2 (PIM2) is a prosurvival factor of cancer cells and a possible therapeutic target in hematological malignancies. However,the attempts at inhibiting PIM2 have yielded underwhelming results in earlyclinical trials on hematological malignancies. Recently, a novel panPIMinhibitor, JP11646, was developed. The present study examined the utility oftargeting PIM2 in multiple solid cancers and investigated the antitumor efficacy and the mechanisms of action of JP11646. When PIM2 expression was comparedbetween normal and cancer tissues in publicly available datasets, PIM2 was found to be overexpressed in several types of solid cancers. PIM2 ectopicoverexpression promoted tumor growth in in vivo xenograft breast cancer mousemodels. The panPIM inhibitor, JP11646, suppressed in vitro cancer cellproliferation in a concentrationdependent manner in multiple types of cancers; a similar result was observed with siRNAmediated PIM2 knockdown, as well as anincreased in cell apoptosis. By contrast, another panPIM inhibitor, AZD1208,suppressed the expression of downstream PIM2 targets, but not PIM2 proteinexpression, corresponding to no apoptosis induction. As a mechanism of PIM2protein degradation, it was found that the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib,reversed the apoptosis induced by JP11646, suggesting that PIM2 degradation byJP11646 is proteasomedependent. JP11646 exhibited significant anticancer efficacywith minimal toxicities at the examined doses and schedules in multiple in vivomice xenograft solid cancer models. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that PIM2 promotes cancer progression in solid tumors. JP11646 induces apoptosis at least partly by PIM2 protein degradation and suppresses cancer cellproliferation in vitro and in vivo. JP11646 may thus be a possible treatmentstrategy for multiple types of solid cancers.

LID - 10.1111/mpp.13252 [doi]
AB  - Plant viruses are known to infect most economically important crops and pose amajor threat to global food security. Currently, few resistant host phenotypeshave been delineated, and while chemicals are used for crop protection againstinsect pests and bacterial or fungal diseases, these are inefficient againstviral diseases. Genetic engineering emerged as a way of modifying the plantgenome by introducing functional genes in plants to improve crop productivityunder adverse environmental conditions. Recently, new breeding technologies, and in particular the exciting CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced shortpalindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins) technology, was shown to be apowerful alternative to engineer resistance against plant viruses, thus has greatpotential for reducing crop losses and improving plant productivity to directlycontribute to food security. Indeed, it could circumvent the "Geneticmodification" issues because it allows for genome editing without the integrationof foreign DNA or RNA into the genome of the host plant, and it is simpler andmore versatile than other new breeding technologies. In this review, we describe the predominant features of the major CRISPR/Cas systems and outline strategiesfor the delivery of CRISPR/Cas reagents to plant cells. We also provide anoverview of recent advances that have engineered CRISPR/Cas-based resistanceagainst DNA and RNA viruses in plants through the targeted manipulation of eitherthe viral genome or susceptibility factors of the host plant genome. Finally, we provide insight into the limitations and challenges that CRISPR/Cas technologycurrently faces and discuss a few alternative applications of the technology invirus research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), the causative agent of classical swine fever (CFS), is a highly contagious disease that poses a serious threat to Chinese pig populations. OBJECTIVES: Many provinces of China, such as Shandong,Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning provinces, have reported epidemics ofCSFV, while the references to the epidemic of CSFV in Yunnan province are rare.This study examined the epidemic characteristics of the CSFV in Yunnan province. METHODS: In this study, 326 tissue samples were collected from different regions in Yunnan province from 2015 to 2021. A reverse transcription-polymerase chainreaction (RT-PCR), sequences analysis, and phylogenetic analysis were performedfor the pathogenic detection and analysis of these 326 clinical specimens.RESULTS: Approximately 3.37% (11/326) of specimens tested positive for the CSFVby RT-PCR, which is lower than that of other regions of China. Sequence analysis of the partial E2 sequences of eleven CSFV strains showed that they shared89.0-100.0% nucleotide (nt) and 95.0-100.0% amino acid (aa) homology,respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel isolates belonged to the subgenotypes 2.1c and 2.1d, with subgenotype 2.1c being predominant.CONCLUSIONS: The CSFV was sporadic in China's Yunnan province from 2015 to 2021. Both 2.1c and 2.1d subgenotypes were found in this region, but 2.1c was dominant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The commercially available Newcastle disease (ND) vaccines weredeveloped based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates genetically divergentfrom field strains that can only prevent clinical disease, not shedding ofvirulent heterologous virus, highlighting the need to develop genotype-matchedvaccines. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the efficacy of the NDVgenotype-matched vaccine, mIBS025 strain formulated in standard vaccinestabilizer, and in carboxymethyl sago starch-acid hydrogel (CMSS-AH) followingvaccination via an eye drop (ED) and drinking water (DW). METHODS: A challengevirus was prepared from a recent NDV isolated from ND vaccinated flock. Groups ofspecific-pathogen-free chickens were vaccinated with mIBS025 vaccine strainprepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer and CMSS-AH via ED and DW and thenchallenged with the UPM/NDV/IBS362/2016 strain. RESULTS: Chickens vaccinated withCMSS-AH mIBS025 ED (group 2) developed the earliest and highest Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) NDV antibody titer (8log2) followed by standard mIBS025 ED (group3) (7log2) both conferred complete protection and drastically reduced virusshedding. By contrast, chickens vaccinated with standard mIBS025 DW (group 5) andCMSS-AH mIBS025 DW (group 4) developed low HI NDV antibody titers of 4log2 and3log2, respectively, which correspondingly conferred only 50% and 60% protection and continuously shed the virulent virus via the oropharyngeal and cloacal routesuntil the end of the study at 14 dpc. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of mIBS025vaccines prepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer or CMSS-AH was affected by thevaccination routes. The groups vaccinated via ED had better protective immunitythan those vaccinated via DW.

AB  - Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, humans have been exposed to distinctSARS-CoV-2 antigens, either by infection with different variants, and/orvaccination. Population immunity is thus highly heterogeneous, but the impact of such heterogeneity on the effectiveness and breadth of the antibody-mediatedresponse is unclear. We measured antibody-mediated neutralisation responsesagainst SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha, SARS-CoV-2delta and SARS-CoV-2omicronpseudoviruses using sera from patients with distinct immunological histories,including naive, vaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha orSARS-CoV-2delta, and vaccinated/infected individuals. We show that the breadthand potency of the antibody-mediated response is influenced by the number, thevariant, and the nature (infection or vaccination) of exposures, and thatindividuals with mixed immunity acquired by vaccination and natural exposureexhibit the broadest and most potent responses. Our results suggest that theinterplay between host immunity and SARS-CoV-2 evolution will shape theantigenicity and subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, with importantimplications for future vaccine design.

TI  - Tick-Borne Pathogens in Questing Blacklegged Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) From PikeCounty, Pennsylvania.
LID - tjac107 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac107 [doi]
AB  - Active surveillance was conducted by collecting questing ticks from vegetationthrough a 2-yr survey in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Over a thousand blackleggedticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) and American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis Say)were collected. A single specimen of the following species was collected: lonestar tick (Amblyomma americanum L.), rabbit tick (Haemaphysalis leporispalustris Packard), and an Asian longhorned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann). This study represents the largest county-wide study in Pennsylvania, surveying 988questing I. scapularis adult and nymphs. Molecular detection of five distincttick-borne pathogens was screened through real-time PCR at a single tickresolution. Respectively, the overall 2-yr adult and nymph prevalence werehighest with Borrelia burgdorferi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetacceae) (45.99%,18.94%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) (12.29%,7.95%) where the variant-ha (8.29%, 3.03%) was overall more prevalent than thevariant-v1 (2.49%, 4.17%), Babesia microti (Piroplasmida: Babesiidae) (4.97%,5.30%), Borrelia miyamotoi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae) (1.38%, 1.89%), and Powassan virus lineage II [POWV]/deer tick virus (DTV) (2.07%, 0.76%). Adult and nymph coinfection prevalence of B. burgdorferi and B. microti (3.03%, 4.97%) and adult coinfection of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum or A. phagocytophilum and B. microti were significantly higher than the independent infection rateexpected naturally. This study highlights the urgency to conduct diversesurveillance studies with large sample sizes to better understand the human risk for tick-borne diseases within small geographical areas.

TI  - Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceuticals in wastewater treated forbeneficial reuse: Two case studies in central Pennsylvania.
LID - 10.1002/jeq2.20398 [doi]
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance was leveraged as a powerfultool for monitoring community-scale health. Further, the well-known persistenceof some pharmaceuticals through wastewater treatment plants spurred concerns thatincreased usage of pharmaceuticals during the pandemic would increase theconcentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluent. We collected weeklyinfluent and effluent samples from May 2020 through May 2021 from two wastewater treatment plants in central Pennsylvania, the Penn State Water ReclamationFacility and the University Area Joint Authority, that provide effluent forbeneficial reuse, including for irrigation. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 (influent only), two over-the-counter medicines (acetaminophen and naproxen),five antibiotics (ampicillin, doxycycline, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, andtrimethoprim), two therapeutic agents (remdesivir and dexamethasone), andhydroxychloroquine. While there were no correlations between pharmaceutical andvirus concentration, remdesivir detection occurred when the number ofhospitalized COVID-19 patients increased and dexamethasone detection co-occurred with the presence of COVID-19 patients on ventilators. Additionally, Penn Statedecision-making regarding instruction modes explained the temporal variation ofinfluent pharmaceutical concentrations, with detection occurring primarily whenstudents were on campus. Risk quotients calculated for pharmaceuticals with knownEC50 or LC50 values for fish, daphnia, and algae were generally low in theeffluent; however, some acute risks from sulfamethoxazole and dexamethasone were high when students returned to campus. Remdesivir and dexamethasone persistedthrough the wastewater treatment plants, thereby introducing novelpharmaceuticals directly to soils and surface water. These results highlightconnections between human health and water quality during and further demonstratebroad utility of wastewater surveillance.

TI  - Human immunodeficiency virus infection and risks of morbidity and death in adultswith incident heart failure.
PG  - oeab040
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab040 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases the risk of heart failure(HF), but whether it influences subsequent morbidity and mortality remainsunclear. Methods and results: We investigated the risks of hospitalization forHF, HF-related emergency department (ED) visits, and all-cause death in anobservational cohort of incident HF patients with and without HIV using data fromthree large US integrated healthcare delivery systems. We estimated incidencerates and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) by HIV status at the time of HF diagnosisfor subsequent outcomes. We identified 448 persons living with HIV (PLWH) and3429 without HIV who developed HF from a frequency-matched source cohort of 38868 PLWH and 386 586 without HIV. Mean age was 59.5 +/- 11.3 years with 9.8%women and 31.8% Black, 13.1% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian/Pacific Islander. Compared with persons without HIV, PLWH had similar adjusted rates of HF hospitalization[aHR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81-1.26] and of HF-related ED visits[aHR 1.22 (95% CI: 0.99-1.50)], but higher adjusted rates of all-cause death [aHR1.31 (95% CI: 1.08-1.58)]. Adjusted rates of HF-related morbidity and all-causedeath were directionally consistent across a wide range of CD4 counts but mostpronounced in the subset with a baseline CD4 count <200 or 200-499 cells/muL.Conclusion: In a large, diverse cohort of adults with incident HF receiving care within integrated healthcare delivery systems, PLWH were at an independentlyhigher risk of all-cause death but not HF hospitalizations or HF-related EDvisits. Future studies investigating modifiable HIV-specific risk factors mayfacilitate more personalized care to optimize outcomes for PLWH and HF.

PG  - veac062
LID - 10.1093/ve/veac062 [doi]
AB  - China experienced a resurgence of seasonal influenza activity throughout 2021despite intermittent control measures and prolonged international border closure.We show genomic evidence for multiple A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B/Victoriatransmission lineages circulating over 3 years, with the 2021 resurgence mainlydriven by two B/Victoria clades. Phylodynamic analysis revealed unsampledancestry prior to widespread outbreaks in December 2020, showing that influenzalineages can circulate cryptically under non-pharmaceutical interventions enactedagainst COVID-19. Novel haemagglutinin gene mutations and altered age profiles ofinfected individuals were observed, and Jiangxi province was identified as amajor source for nationwide outbreaks. Following major holiday periods,fluctuations in the effective reproduction number were observed, underscoring theimportance of influenza vaccination prior to holiday periods or travel. Extensiveheterogeneity in seasonal influenza circulation patterns in China determined byhistorical strain circulation indicates that a better understanding ofdemographic patterns is needed for improving effective controls.

AB  - Human ACE2 Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the key cellattachment and entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), with the original SARS-CoV-2 isolates unable to use mouse ACE2(mACE2). Herein we describe the emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 strain capable ofACE2-independent infection and the evolution of mouse-adapted (MA) SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro serial passaging of virus in co-cultures of cell lines expressing hACE2 and mACE2. MA viruses evolved with up to five amino acid changes in the spikeprotein, all of which have been seen in human isolates. MA viruses replicated to high titers in C57BL/6J mouse lungs and nasal turbinates and causedcharacteristic lung histopathology. One MA virus also evolved to replicateefficiently in several ACE2-negative cell lines across several species, includingclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associatedprotein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) ACE2 knockout cells. An E484D substitution is likelyinvolved in ACE2-independent entry and has appeared in only approximately 0.003per cent of human isolates globally, suggesting that it provided no significantselection advantage in humans. ACE2-independent entry reveals a SARS-CoV-2infection mechanism that has potential implications for disease pathogenesis,evolution, tropism, and perhaps also intervention development.

TI  - Investigation of the target genes of BLV miRNAs and the expression levels ofmiR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p in cattle infected with Bovine Leukemia Virus.
PG  - 265-274
LID - 10.30466/vrf.2020.123330.2908 [doi]
AB  - Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) is an oncogenic retrovirus of the genusDeltaretrovirus. The genome of BLV encodes a cluster of 10 mature microRNAs(miRNAs). Considering the importance of miRNAs in regulating gene expression, it seems that each of the miRNAs of BLV plays a vital role in the process ofpathogenesis and tumorigenesis of the virus. First, sequences of each of themiRNAs of BLV were selected and downloaded from the miRBase database. Thesequences were then investigated using TargetScan and miRWalk to identify target genes of each of the mature miRNAs of the virus. Second, the expression levels ofthe two miRNAs with the highest number of target genes in B lymphocytes andlymphoid tissues were evaluated using qPCR and were compared between cattle with different forms of BLV infection: PL form was compared to aleukemic (AL) form(Group 1) and BLV+ with normal lymph nodes were compared to lymphosarcoma form(Group 2). We identified a total of 1595 target genes of the micro RNAs. ThemiRNAs with the highest target genes included miR-B4-3p with 760 and B2-5p with102 target genes. In the second phase, miRNA expression in BLV-infected animalswas investigated. The Fold Change (FC) values for miR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p ingroup 1 were 22 and 67, respectively. In the second group, the FCs for miR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p were 47 and 133, respectively. The expression was significantlyhigher in persistent lymphocytosis (PL) cattle in group one and lymphosarcomacattle in group two.

PG  - 627-630
LID - 10.46234/ccdcw2022.139 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem in China. In2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a goal to eliminate viralhepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, and in 2018, the National HealthCommission of China launched Hepatitis C Elimination Action by 2030. Hepatitis C control and prevention has made significant progress in China in recent years. Toimplement the "Healthy China 2030" plan and the Healthy China Initiative(2019-2030), and to contribute to the global target of eliminating viralhepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, the National Health Commission ofChina and eight other government departments jointly issued the National ActionPlan for Eliminating Hepatitis C as a Public Health Threat (2021-2030)(hereinafter referred to as the "National Plan") in 2021. The National Plan hasan overarching goal and 15 specific targets that cover health education,comprehensive prevention interventions, testing and treatment, and capacitybuilding. The National Plan introduces key tasks and strategies of "fivestrengthenings, one expanding, and one implementation," i.e., strengtheninghealth education, comprehensive prevention, referral and treatment, drug supply, and information management; expanding testing; and implementing relevant medical insurance policies. The National Plan also proposes key guaranteeing measures of "four intensifications and one mobilization," i.e., intensification oforganizational leadership, capacity building, scientific research andinternational cooperation, and supervision and fulfillment; mobilization ofsocial participation. The National Plan is an important component of the Healthy China initiative, adhering to the integration of treatment and prevention anddeepening the "integration of medical treatment, medical insurance, and medicine supplies." In this review, we describe the National Plan and discuss itschallenges and prospects.

LID - 10.7150/ijms.71286 [doi]
AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune response and produces protectiveantibodies, and these changes may persist after patients discharged fromhospital. Methods: This study conducted a one-year follow-up study on patientswith COVID-19 to observe the dynamic changes of circulating leukocyte subsets andvirus-specific antibodies. Results: A total of 66 patients with COVID-19 and 213 healthy patients with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were included. Thevirus-specific total antibody, IgG and IgM antibody of patients after one year ofrecovery were higher than those of healthy vaccinated participants (94.13 vs4.65, 2.67 vs 0.44, 0.09 vs 0.06, respectively) (P < 0.001). Neutrophil count (OR= 1.73, 95% CI: 1.10-2.70, P = 0.016) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR =1.59, 95% CI: 1.05-2.41, P = 0.030) at discharge were the influencing factors forthe positivity of virus-specific IgG antibody in patients after one year ofrecovery. The counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T, B and NK cells increased with the timeof recovery, and remained basically stable from 9 to 12 months after discharge.After 12 months, the positivity of IgG antibody was 85.3% and IgM was 11.8%,while the virus-specific antibody changed dynamically in patients within one yearafter discharge. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody of recoveredpatients showed dynamic fluctuation after discharge, while the leukocyte subsets gradually increased and basically stabilized after 9 months.

PG  - 2670
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2670 [doi]
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) led to extreme actions being taken by the governments to restrict the spread of this virus.Closure of schools, sport clubs and playgrounds were among these actions;children had to stay indoors and were not allowed to pursue their normallifestyle activities. Objectives: To assess the differences in health-relatedbehaviors among Jordanian school-aged children (6-16 years) before and duringCOVID-19 quarantine and to evaluate public's perception of the role ofpharmacists regarding children's health-related behaviors management. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to January 2021 using ananonymous web-based survey. The survey was developed based on previouslypublished surveys. Evaluation of the validity and reliability of the survey were conducted by a professional committee of clinical pharmacists and a statistician.Results: A total of 230 children, aged 9.02+/- 2.977 participated in the study.Physical activity and healthy balanced meals decreased (less than 1 hr or 1-3hrs/week vs 2 meals/day, p= <0.001), whereas daily screen time (1-3 hrs/week vs4-6 hrs/week, p= <0.001), sleep hours (8-9 hrs/day vs 10-11 hrs/day, p= <0.001)and the ingestion of unhealthy snacks had increased (1-2 meals/day vs. 2-3meals/day, p=<0.001). A positive perception of pharmacists' role during thepandemic was revealed. Conclusion: The present study showed that a significantchange in children's health-related behavior happened during the COVID-19pandemic. Such changes can lead to social, physical and mental health problems.The public perceived community pharmacists as trusted health care professionalsduring the pandemic.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the co-infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) amongpatients with asthma exacerbation and COVID-19 in Jordan. Also, to determine the frequency of acute asthma exacerbation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic ona matched basis. Methods: The data of this prospective cohort research consisted of clinical variables. During the first visit, and after 14-days, nasopharyngeal swabs were taken and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed forHRV and SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results: Forty-seven out of 175 (26.9%) COVID-19adult cases have been diagnosed with asthma. The number of asthma exacerbationsamong the study participants was higher during 2021 than in 2020 (p=0.035). Most of the included asthmatic participants (61.7%) were only positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 38.3% were co-infected with HRV. The SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold value waslower in samples infected with both viruses compared to samples infected withSARS-CoV-2 alone, p<0.005. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that HRV andSARS-CoV-2 were significantly more prevalent in asthma exacerbations than stable asthma. Thus, HRV and/or SARS-CoV-2 infections were potentially cofactors orcontributors to the asthma exacerbation in this cohort. This is the first study, in Jordan, to investigate the HRV co-infection in COVID-19 asthmatic patients andHRV could be related with a higher severity of COVID-19.

AB  - With the frequent detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) in dwellings and wastewater, the risk of transmission ofenvironmental contaminants is of great concern. Fast, simple and sensitivesensors are essential for timely detecting infection and controlling transmissionthrough environment fomites. Herein, we developed a Surface Enhanced RamanScattering (SERS) aptasensor, which can realize ultrasensitive and rapid assay ofSARS-CoV-2 viral particles. In this strategy, we designed a novel lockingamplifier which is activated only in the presence of virus by aptamerrecognition. The reaction process was carried out though one-pot method at 37degrees C, which can save time and resources. In addition, magnetic beads used inreaction system can simplify operation, as well as provide ideas for developingbiosensing robots via magnetic field. This SERS aptasensor can detect SARS-CoV-2 virus with a LOD of 260 TU/microL within 40 min in the linear range of 625-10000 TU/microL. Therefore, this convenience, speediness, sensitivity, and selectivity of detection has great prospects in analyzing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles or otherviruses in environment as well as monitoring of environmental virus sources.

TI  - Integrin-directed antibody-based immunotherapy: focus on VLA-4.
PG  - ltab002
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab002 [doi]
AB  - One major finding of chronic inflammatory diseases of various origins is theestablishment of inflammatory infiltrates, bearing different leukocytesubpopulations, including activated T lymphocytes. Integrins are among the large series of molecular interactions that have been implicated as players in bothtriggering and maintenance of leukocyte influx from the blood into a given organ parenchyme. Accordingly, blocking the interaction between VLA-6 integrin andlaminin, experimentally abrogates heart graft rejection. Many reports have shown that VLA-4 is used by T cells to cross endothelial barriers, as well as tomigrate within target tissues. In this respect, a humanized IgG4 anti-VLA-4monoclonal antibody (specific to the alpha4-integrin chain of VLA-4) has beensuccessfully applied to treat multiple sclerosis as well as inflammatory boweldisease. Anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody has also been applied to blocktransendothelial passage in other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoidarthritis. On this same vein is the action of such a reagent in impairing invitro transendothial and fibronectin-driven migration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) Tcells expressing high densities of VLA-4 from Duchenne muscular dystrophypatients, thus potentially enlarging the use of this strategy to other diseases. Yet, in a small number of patients, the use of Natalizumab has been correlatedwith the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a serious brain infectioncaused by the John Cunningham virus. This issue restricted the use of thereagent. In this respect, the development of smaller and more specific antibodyreagents should be envisioned as a next-generation promising strategy.

AB  - World Health Organization has defined COVID-19 as a contagious, communicable and fast spreading disease engendered by the Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, is arespirational microorganism. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan images of thechest helps in detecting COVID 19 infection in a fast way with much reliability. In this paper, chest CT scan images of COVID and Non-COVID categories areconsidered to train the supervised classifier, Iterative convolution NeuralNetwork. The training process is done with six different training data size. The trained models are iterated for the fixed size of testing data (20 images). Thesame set of training and testing processes are done with two different Iterative Convolutional Neural Network architectures, one with two hidden layers (CNN1) andanother with three hidden layers (CNN2). The iterations are extended up to 7, butthe model performance is degraded after the 6(th) iteration, which makes to fixthe iteration level as 5 for both CNN models. Six different training sets withfive iterations have led into 30 CNN models. For two different CNN architectures,which lead to 60 different models. The model designed with 100 training sets inboth CNN1 and CNN2, have produced the high accuracy in COVID classification than any other models. The better classification accuracy 89% is achieved from CNN2model with its 5(th) iteration.

PG  - 115372
LID - 10.1016/j.cma.2022.115372 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges to humanity nowadays.COVID-19 virus can replicate in the host's larynx region, which is in contrast toother viruses that replicate in lungs only, i.e. SARS. This is conjectured tosupport a fast spread of COVID-19. However, there is sparse research in thisfield about quantitative comparison of virus load in the larynx for varyingsusceptible individuals. In this regard the lung geometry itself could influence the risk of reproducing more pathogens and consequently exhaling more virus.Disadvantageously, there are only sparse lung geometries available. To still beable to investigate realistic geometrical deviations we employ three differentdigital replicas of human airways up to the 7 th level of bifurcation,representing two realistic lungs (male and female) as well as a more simplifiedexperimental model. Our aim is to investigate the influence of breathingscenarios on aerosol deposition in anatomically different, realistic humanairways. In this context, we employ three levels of cardiovascular activity aswell as reported experimental particle size distributions by means ofComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with special focus on the larynx region toenable new insights into the local virus loads in human respiratory tracts. Inaddition, the influence of more realistic boundary conditions is investigated by performing transient simulations of a complete respiratory cycle in the upperlung regions of the considered respiratory models, focusing in particular ondeposition in the oral cavity, the laryngeal region, and trachea, whilesimplifying the tracheobronchial tree. The aerosol deposition is modeled viaOpenFOAM(\protect \relax \special {t4ht=(R)}) by employing an Euler-Lagrangianframe including steady and unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)resolved turbulent flow using the k- omega -SST and k- omega -SST DES turbulence models. We observed that the respiratory geometry altered the local depositionpatterns, especially in the laryngeal region. Despite the larynx region, theeffects of varying flow rate for the airway geometries considered were found tobe similar in the majority of respiratory tract regions. For all particle sizedistributions considered, localized particle accumulation occurred in the larynx of all considered lung models, which were more pronounced for larger particlesize distributions. Moreover, it was found, that employing transient simulations instead of steady-state analysis, the overall particle deposition pattern ismaintained, however with a stronger intensity in the transient cases.

AB  - In the bone marrow, plasma cells are made up of B lymphocytes and are a type ofWBC. These plasma cells produce antibodies that help to keep bacteria and virusesat bay, thus preventing inflammation. This presents a major challenge forsegmenting blood cells, since numerous image processing methods are used beforesegmentation to enhance image quality. White blood cells can be analyzed by apathologist with the aid of computer software to identify blood diseasesaccurately and early. This study proposes a novel model that uses the ResNet and UNet networks to extract features and then segments leukocytes from bloodsamples. Based on the experimental results, this model appears to perform well,which suggests it is an appropriate tool for the analysis of hematology data. By evaluating the model using three datasets consisting of three different types of WBC, a cross-validation technique was applied to assess it based on the publicly available dataset. The overall segmentation accuracy of the proposed model wasaround 96%, which proved that the model was better than previous approaches, suchas DeepLabV3+ and ResNet-50.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma is a significant global health challenge with steadilyincreasing incidence in the East Asia region. While both Hepatitis C and B virus infections account for the majority of HCC cases, the advent of potent antiviralsagainst HCV infection has biased the aetiology towards chronic HBV infection thatat the moment remains without an effective cure. For this reason, HBV-HCC remainsa persistent global problem. Treatment options for intermediate to advancedstages of HBV-HCC remain limited, hence novel therapeutic strategies are requiredto fulfil this medical need. Following the considerable success of adoptiveT-cell immunotherapy against B-cell malignancies, it is conceivable to envisionwhether the same could be achieved against HBV-HCC. In this review, we describethe development of T-cell therapy strategies for HBV-HCC and discuss the safetyand the efficacy of the strategies in terms of the direct killing of tumour cellsand the other alterations possibly induced by the action of the T cells.

TI  - Laboratory investigation of cases of fatal bacterial pneumonia in dairy cows.
PG  - 845-850
AB  - Objective: Bacterial bronchopneumonia occurs in mature dairy cows but much of theinformation is extrapolated from knowledge of the disease in calves. The studywas prompted by perceptions of an increasing occurrence and a paucity ofinformation on fatal Mannheimia haemolytica pneumonia in dairy cows in Ontario.The study objectives were to describe the seasonality, main pathogens involved,and suggested predisposing factors for cases of fatal bacterial bronchopneumonia in mature dairy cows submitted for postmortem examination to a diagnosticlaboratory, and to evaluate if the frequency of such submissions has increasedover time. Animals: Mature dairy cows. Procedure: Retrospective study of casessubmitted for postmortem examination to a diagnostic laboratory from 2007-2020that were diagnosed as bacterial bronchopneumonia. Results: Most of thepostmortem cases of bacterial bronchopneumonia in dairy cows were submitted from November to February (54% of cases). Mannheimia haemolytica was isolated fromlung of 61/101 cases. Viruses were only identified in 8/55 cases tested. Aminority (29/92) of bacterial isolates had in vitro resistance to antimicrobials used to treat pneumonia. Frequently suggested predisposing factors includedrecent introductions or movement of animals, recent or imminent calving,inclement weather, concurrent diseases, and poor ventilation in barns. Conclusionand clinical relevance: This study describes seasonal and annual trends, majorpathogens, antimicrobial resistance profiles, and suggested predisposing factors in Ontario dairy cows submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for postmorteminvestigation of pneumonia and provides insights for understanding why outbreaks occur.

AB  - We present a patient with untreated hepatitis C virus and metastatichepatocellular carcinoma treated with combination immunotherapy who developedelevated liver enzymes. The immunotherapy was withheld, and the liver enzymescontinued to rise. A liver biopsy was performed, which demonstrated findingsconsistent with chronic viral hepatitis. Direct-acting antiviral treatment wasinitiated, and the liver enzymes returned to normal limits. This casedemonstrates the diagnostic dilemmas raised among patients with hepatocellularcarcinoma on immunotherapy who develop elevated liver enzymes and some of thechallenges regarding the use of these medications in patients with viremichepatitis C virus.

TI  - ALD based nanostructured zinc oxide coated antiviral silk fabric.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of research and development in maintaining public health. Facing unprecedented challenges, the scientificcommunity developed antiviral drugs, virucides, and vaccines to combat theinfection within the past two years. However, an ever-increasing list of highlyinfectious SARS-CoV-2 variants (gamma, delta, omicron, and now ba.2 stealth) has exacerbated the problem: again raising the issues of infection preventionstrategies and the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE). Against this backdrop, we report an antimicrobial fabric for PPE applications. We havefabricated a nanofibrous silk-PEO material using electrospinning followed by zincoxide thin film deposition by employing the atomic layer deposition technique.The composite fabric has shown 85% more antibacterial activity than the controlfabric and was found to possess substantial superoxide dismutase-mimeticactivity. The composite was further subjected to antiviral testing using twodifferent respiratory tract viruses: coronavirus (OC43: enveloped) and rhinovirus(RV14: non-enveloped). We report a 95% reduction in infectious virus for bothOC43 and RV14 from an initial load of approximately 1 x 10(5) (sample size: 6 mm dia. disk), after 1 h of white light illumination. Furthermore, with 2 h ofillumination, approximately 99% reduction in viral infectivity was observed forRV14. High activity in a relatively small area of fabric (3.5 x 10(3) viral unitsper mm(2)) makes this antiviral fabric ideal for application in masks/PPE, withan enhanced ability to prevent antimicrobial infection overall.

AB  - COVID-19 has been one of the common infections that have affected numerouschildren across the world in the last two years. The clinical manifestations ofthis virus are varied, ranging from being asymptomatic to affecting multipleorgan systems. There is a lot of ongoing research to find out the differentmanifestations that this infection can have in both adults and children. As with any viral illness, skin is one of the most commonly affected organs, and manyviral illnesses can present with a rash. In our case, we found it interestingthat our patient who tested positive for COVID-19 had a rash that began on theday of her initial presentation and evolved over time as the disease progressed, and hence, we thought it was important to highlight this rare case presentationas a cutaneous finding in children with COVID-19 infection.

TI  - The AAV-PCSK9 murine model of atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction.
PG  - oeac028
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac028 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Mouse models with genetic modifications are required to investigateatherogenesis and associated metabolic syndrome. Adeno-associated virus-8(AAV8)-mediated overexpression of PCSK9 (AAV8-PCSK9) induces hyperlipidaemia and promotes atherosclerosis in C57BL/6 mice. We aimed to assess whetherAAV8-PCSK9-injected C57BL/6 mice fed high-fat diet with added cholesterol (HFD-C)would serve as a model of combined metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis.Methods and results: C57BL/6 mice received i.v. injection of AAV-PCSK9 and sex-and age-matched Ldlr(-/-) and C57BL/6 control mice were placed on HFD-C or chowdiet for 20 weeks (B6-PCSK9-HFD-C, Ldlr(-/-) HFD-C, B6-HFD-C, and B6-Chow,respectively). High-fat diet with added cholesterol feeding led to insulinresistance and impaired glucose clearance in B6-PCSK9-HFD-C mice compared withB6-Chow controls. This decrease in metabolic health in B6-PCSK9-HFD-C mice aswell as the development of atherosclerosis was similar to Ldlr(-/-) HFD-C mice.Importantly, HFD-C feeding induced pancreatic islet hyperplasia in B6-PCSK9-HFD-Cand B6-HFD-C compared with B6-Chow controls. In line with alterations in themetabolic phenotype, there was an increase in the number of pro-inflammatoryLy6C(high/med) monocytes within the adipose tissues of B6-PCSK9-HFD-C andB6-HFD-C compared with B6-Chow controls. Conclusion: High-fat diet with addedcholesterol-fed AAV-PCSK9-injected C57BL/6 mice can serve as a useful model ofintegrated metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis that does not require geneticmanipulations.

TI  - The Impact of the Highly Virulent SARS-CoV-2 Gamma Variant on Young Adults in theState of Sao Paulo: Was It Inevitable?
PG  - e26486
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26486 [doi]
AB  - Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had and is stillhaving a tremendous impact on people all over the world, but it has beenparticularly harsh in South America. Nine out of 13 South American countries are among the 50 countries with the highest COVID-19 death rates. The gamma severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant that emerged by theend of 2020 in the Brazilian Amazon quickly spread throughout the country causingthe harsh COVID-19 second wave. This variant displayed high viral loads, hightransmissibility, and increased virulence as compared to previous variants. Aims The aim of this retrospective study is to revisit and analyse the epidemiology ofthe COVID-19 second wave in the state of Sao Paulo, the most populous Brazilianstate. In addition to examining the possible factors that led to the emergenceand propagation of the gamma variant, measures that could have prevented itsspread and that of other highly virulent variants were also investigated.Materials and methods Data from Sao Paulo's official sources on morbidity,mortality, age distribution, and testing prior to and during the COVID-19 second wave (February - June 2021) and data regarding the distribution of SARS-CoV-2variants in the country were parsed, analyzed, and compared to the period thatanteceded the eruption of the second COVID-19 wave. Results In the state of SaoPaulo, the toll of the COVID-19 second wave surpassed that of the first 11 monthsof the pandemic (from March 2020 to January 2021), as 56% of the deaths occurred in the five months of the second wave between February and June 2021. The meanage of COVID-19 victims, which was already below life expectancy in the statedropped even further in the pandemic's second wave, reaching an average of 60years of age. The years of life lost per death per month doubled and thecase-fatality rate (CFR) of young adults (20-39 years old) more than trebledduring this period. A number of hypotheses have been raised that might explainthe emergence and spread of the gamma variant and the measures that could havebeen taken to prevent it and minimise its impact on the population. ConclusionsOver 142,000 people died as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma variant sweep in SaoPaulo in the first semester of 2021. Due to its high viral load, the gammavariant displayed high transmissibility and a high degree of virulence resulting in increased case fatality rates across most age tiers. Notably, this second wavewas marked by a very significant increase in deaths among young adults. Thisincrease was at least partially due to a deterioration in general health provokedby non-pharmaceutical interventions. In hindsight, a safer and more effectivemeasure might have been to allow the free spread of the virus among the young andhealthy in the first wave, thus conferring immunity against more virulentvariants that emerged later on.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a multisystemic disease caused most frequently byMycobacterium tuberculosis. Extrapulmonary TB has become more frequent with theadvent of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as HIV can facilitate the infection with M. tuberculosis, especially during HIV seroconversion. Here, we present the case of a 22-year-old man, from Guinea-Bissau, with a history of untreated HIVwho was admitted to the intensive care unit for respiratory failure needingmechanical ventilation. Pulmonary TB was diagnosed. His stay was complicated witha hemorrhagic shock due to traumatic urethral catheterization, which led to aperforation of the capsule of the prostate. A prostatectomy was needed forbleeding control. The anatomopathological examination confirmed the presence ofacid-resistant bacilli, and an extensive caseous type necrosis of the wholetissue, thus diagnosing a prostatic tuberculosis. The patient recovered after ahemorrhagic shock, a urologic and radical intervention, and some severeinfectious complications.

AB  - Background: Globally, India is the country with the highest tuberculosis (TB)burden with respect to the number of new cases occurring each year. Annualincident cases of TB in India accounts for more than 25% of total TB morbidityand mortality worldwide. Several factors have been associated with the adherence of TB medication, which can be broadly classified as patient/personal, social,structural and health service. The aims of the present study were to determinethe compliance to daily regimen of directly observed treatment, short-course(DOTS) therapy among TB patients registered at the Tuberculosis Unit (TU) ofMangalore and to identify the factors influencing non-compliance for treatment.Methods: A cross sectional study was performed. The study sample was drawn fromthe TUs, General Hospital, Mangalore, after taking permission from District TBOfficer. The names and addresses of TB patients were collected from treatmentcards. The TB patients were approached at their homes/DOTS centers/Primary HealthCentre's (PHCs) with the help of senior treatment supervisors. Results: It wasfound that patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were morelikely to be non-adherent, which was statistically significant. Amongst theparticipants, 66 (33%) were diabetic and 28.8% of them were found to benon-adherent. The proportion of non-adherence was 27 times higher in those withpoor patient provider relationships. Patients who reported to have side effectsof TB medication were 5.23 times more likely to be non-adherent. Conclusions:Advice on routine consultation with the health care facility, adherence totreatment regimen and education about its benefits should be the prime focus ofproviding health education to all TB patients, both at the individual andcommunity levels.

AB  - Background: Effective measures to control COVID-19 should be based on anunderstanding of its epidemiological pattern and the evaluation of its prevalencein the community. This study aimed to examine the reproductive number (R) ofCOVID-19 and its trend in Fars Province in southern Iran. Methods: In thisecological study, the R trend was examined from July to November 2020. Data were collected from the daily reports of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. R isthe product of three components, namely the number of infection-producingcontacts per unit time, the probability of transmission per contact, and thecontagiousness period. Incidence and prevalence rates were used to calculate R.The R value was calculated in Microsoft Excel 2016. Results: The first and secondpeaks of COVID-19 were observed on July 6(th) and November 22(nd), respectively. The median and mean of R were 1.42 and 1.41, respectively. The highest and lowestvalues of R were observed on October 20(th) (2.60) and September 1(st) (0.46),respectively. The values of R had a slightly decreasing trend in the second half of July and November than the first half. In the second half of August andSeptember, an increasing trend was observed than the first half. There was notmuch change in the second half of October. Conclusion: The highest value of R wasrelated to the dates when there was a higher probability of exposure to thevirus, including public holidays and different occasions on which the probabilityof people's participation in ceremonies, communities, and gatherings was higher.

AB  - Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2), a virulent and contagious viralpathogen that affects wild and domestic lagomorph populations, was identified in Wyoming, USA in December 2020. A surveillance program was developed involvingfull-carcass submission and liver analysis, although carcass quality as a result of predation and decomposition impeded analysis. To increase the number ofsubmissions and provide flexibility to field staff, we evaluated 2 sample types: 77 dried blood on filter paper samples, 66 ear punch samples. At initialsampling, test specificity and sensitivity of the RT-rtPCR utilizing dried blood on filter paper and ear punch samples were both 100% compared to liver. Filterpaper results were consistent over time; sensitivity stayed >96% through weeks 2,4, and 6, with a maximum mean difference of 6.0 Ct from baseline liver Ct values (95% CI: 5.0-7.3) at 6 wk. Test sensitivity of the ear punch sample at 1, 3, 5,and 7 wk post-sampling remained at 100%, with a maximum mean difference of 5.6 Ctfrom baseline liver Ct values (95% CI: 4.3-6.9) at 5 wk. Filter paper and earpunch samples were suitable alternatives to liver for RHDV2 surveillance in wild lagomorph populations. Alternative sampling options provide more flexibility tosurveillance programs, increase testable submissions, and decrease exposure offield personnel to zoonotic disease agents.

TI  - Understanding the barriers and facilitators to using self-sampling packs forsexually transmitted infections and blood-borne viruses: Thematic analyses forintervention optimization.
LID - 10.1111/bjhp.12617 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Self-sampling packs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) andblood-borne viruses (BBVs) are widely offered. There are ongoing problems withreach and sample return rates. The packs have arisen without formal intervention development. This paper illustrates initial steps of an intervention optimizationprocess to improve the packs. METHODS: Eleven focus groups and seven interviewswere conducted with convenience samples of patients recruited from sexual health clinics and members of the public (n = 56). To enable intervention optimization, firstly, we conducted an inductive appraisal of the behavioural system of usingthe pack to understand meaningful constituent behavioural domains. Subsequently, we conducted a thematic analysis of barriers and facilitators to enacting eachsequential behavioural domain in preparation for future behaviour change wheelanalysis. RESULTS: Overall, we found that self-sampling packs were acceptable.Participants understood their overall logic and value as a pragmatic interventionthat simultaneously facilitated and reduced barriers to individuals being tested for STIs and BBVs. However, at the level of each behavioural domain (e.g.,reading leaflets, returning samples) problems with the pack were identified, aswell as a series of potential optimizations, which might widen the reach ofself-sampling and increase the return of viable samples. CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides an example of a pragmatic approach to optimizing an intervention alreadywidely offered globally. The paper demonstrates the added value healthpsychological approaches offer; conceptualizing interventions in behaviouralterms, pinpointing granular behavioural problems amenable for systematic further improvement.

TI  - A Case of Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis in a Lymph Node with Unique Clinical andHistopathologic Features.
PG  - e936862
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.936862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LyG) is a rare lymphoproliferativedisorder associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in which there is an infection of B cells and numerous reactive T cells. The lymphoproliferative disorderprogresses to organ infiltration and resultant dysfunction of affected organs.Histologically, it is characterized by a triad of polymorphic lymphoidinfiltrate, angiitis, and granulomatosis. The lungs are the most commonlyinvolved sites for lymphomatoid granulomatosis, but other sites that can beinvolved include the liver, skin, and central nervous system. The signs andsymptoms of LyG can vary, and can produce generalized symptoms such as cough,shortness of breath, and chest tightness, but can vary depending on the location of LyG. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 60-year-old man who presented withaltered mental status. Cross-sectional imaging of the brain was negative for any acute intracranial process, but a fine-needle biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymphnode revealed nodular polymorphous mononuclear infiltrates containing atypicallarge EBV-positive B cells with positive EBER and CD30, consistent withlymphomatoid granulomatosis. The patient was started on a regimen ofbrentuximab/bendamustine, and instructed to follow up with Oncology on anoutpatient basis. CONCLUSIONS Treatment options for lymphomatoid granulomatosisare based on the disease grading. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis can be classifiedby using a grading system determined by the number of EBV-positive large B cellmalignant cells, along with necrosis. The most effective treatment forlymphomatoid granulomatosis is unknown, but at this time treatment protocols are based on the grade of the disease. The clinical and histological features oflymphomatoid granulomatosis are discussed in this case report.

TI  - PEDOT:PSS in Solution Form Exhibits Strong Potential in Inhibiting SARS-CoV-2Infection of the Host Cells by Targeting Viruses and Also the Host Cells.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00271 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic with over 5 million fatalities. Vaccines against this virus have beenglobally administered; however, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein mutations are continuously identified with strong capability to escape vaccine-elicitedprotection. Due to the high mutation rate and transmission ability, thedevelopment of a broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor is highly in demand. In thisstudy, the effect of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS) against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated. The treatment of pseudovirusescarrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with PEDOT:PSS strongly blocked SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in human ACE2-expressing cells without causingcytotoxicity. Specifically, PEDOT:PSS showed great potential in both inactivatingviruses and rendering antiviral activity to the treated cells. The effects ofother PEDOT:PSS solutions with different chemical ratios and properties were alsovalidated to find the high inhibition capacity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirusinfection. The transcriptomic data reveal that PEDOT:PSS-treated cells wereendowed with transcriptional alteration, and it could be reverted after theremoval of PEDOT:PSS from the culture medium. Importantly, PEDOT:PSS alsoexhibited broad-spectrum inhibition effects on the pseudovirus carrying the spikeprotein isolated from different variants. In combination with the advantage ofhigh biocompatibility, PEDOT:PSS could thus be considered a potential therapeuticand prophylactic material against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus (RV)-specific surveillance studies in the Middle East are limited. Therefore, we aimed to study the clinical characteristics, outcomes, andseasonality of RV-associated acute respiratory infection among hospitalized youngchildren in Jordan. METHODS: We conducted a prospective viral surveillance study and enrolled children <2 years old admitted to a large public hospital in Amman, Jordan (2010-2013). Demographic and clinical data were collected by structuredinterviews and chart abstractions. Nasal and/or throat swabs were collected andtested for a panel of respiratory viruses, and RV genotyping and speciation wasperformed. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 2,641/3,168 children(83.4%). RV was the second most common virus detected (n=1,238; 46.9%) and wasco-detected with another respiratory virus in 730 cases (59.0%). Children with RVco-detection were more likely than those with RV-only detection to haverespiratory distress but had similar outcomes. RV-A accounted for about half ofRV-positive cases (54.7%), while children with RV-C had a higher frequency ofwheezing and reactive airway disease. RV was detected year-round and peakedduring winter. CONCLUSIONS: Though children with RV co-detection had worseclinical findings, neither co-detection nor species affected most clinicaloutcomes. This article is protected by copyright.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a disease affecting the centralnervous system. Over the last decade, the incidence of TBE has steadily increasedin Europe and Asia despite the availably of effective vaccines. Up to 50% ofpatients after TBE suffer from post-encephalitic syndrome that may develop intolong-lasting morbidity. Altered sleep-wake functions have been reported bypatients after TBE. The mechanisms causing these disorders in TBE are largelyunknown to date. As a first step toward a better understanding of the pathologyof TBEV-inducing sleep dysfunctions, we assessed parameters of sleep structure inan established infant rat model of TBE. METHODS: 13-day old Wistar rats wereinfected with 1 x 10(6) FFU Langat virus (LGTV). On day 4, 9, and 21 postinfection, Rotarod (balance and motor coordination) and open field tests (generallocomotor activity) were performed and brains from representative animals werecollected in each subgroup. On day 28 the animals were implanted with atelemetric EEG/EMG system. Sleep recording was continuously performed for 24consecutive hours starting at day 38 post infection and visually scored for Wake,NREM, and REM in 4 s epochs. RESULTS: As a novelty of this study, infectedanimals showed a significant larger percentage of time spend awake during thedark phase and less NREM and REM compared to the control animals (p < 0.01 forall comparisons). Furthermore, it was seen, that during the dark phase the wakebout length in infected animals was prolonged (p = 0.043) and the fragmentationindex decreased (p = 0.0085) in comparison to the control animals. LGTV-infected animals additionally showed a reduced rotarod performance ability at day 4 (p =0.0011) and day 9 (p = 0.0055) and day 21 (p = 0.0037). A lower locomotoractivity was also seen at day 4 (p = 0.0196) and day 9 (p = 0.0473). CONCLUSION: Our data show that experimental TBE in infant rats affects sleep-wake behavior,leads to decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, and impaired moto-coordinativefunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital contact tracing and exposure notification apps have quicklyemerged as a potential solution to achieve timely and effective contact tracingfor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nonetheless, their actual uptake remains limited.Citizens, including patients, are rarely consulted and included in the design andimplementation process. Their contribution supports the acceptability of suchapps, by providing upstream evidence on incentives and potential barriers thatare most relevant to users. The DIGICIT (DIGITal CITizenship) project relied onpatient and citizen partnership in research to better integrate publicperspectives on these apps. In this paper, we present the co-construction processthat led to the survey instrument used in the DIGICIT project and theinterpretation of its results. This approach promotes public participation inresearch on contact tracing and exposure notification apps, as well as relateddigital health applications. OBJECTIVES: This article has three objectives: (1)describe the methodological process to co-construct a questionnaire and interpretthe survey results with patients and citizens, (2) assess their experiencesregarding this methodology, and (3) propose best practices for their involvement in digital health research. METHODS: The DIGICIT project was developed in foursteps: (1) creation of the advisory committee composed of patients and citizens, (2) co-construction of a questionnaire, (3) interpretation of survey results, and(4) assessment of the experience of committee participants. RESULTS: Of the 25applications received for participation in the advisory committee, we selected 12people based on pre-established diversity criteria. Participants initiallygenerated 84 survey questions in the first co-construction meeting, andeventually selected 36 in the final version. Participants made more than 20recommendations when interpreting survey results and suggested carrying out focusgroups with marginalized populations to increase representativity. Theyappreciated their inclusion early in the research process, being listened to and respected, the collective intelligence, and the method used for integrating theirsuggestions. They suggested that the study objectives and roles be betterdefined, that more time in the brainstorming sessions be allowed, and thatdiscussion outside of meetings be encouraged. CONCLUSION: Having patients andcitizens actively participating in this research constitutes the mainmethodological strength. They enriched the study from start to finish, andrecommended the addition of focus groups to seek the perspective of marginalized groups that are typically under-represented from digital health research. Clearcommunication of the project objectives, good organization in meetings, andcontinuous evaluation from participants allow best practices to be achieved forpatients' and citizens' involvement in digital health research. Co-constructionin research generates critical study design ideas through collectiveintelligence. This methodology can be used in various clinical contexts anddifferent healthcare settings.

OAB - COVID Alert is a mobile application (app) that was developed created to helplimit the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Although promising, these apps have notbeen widely used by the population, in part due to limited citizen engagement in their design. The DIGICIT project (DIGITal CITizenship) was carried out inpartnership with citizens, including patients, to gather public perspective inQuebec, Canada about the COVID Alert app. The purpose of this article is todescribe our method of constructing a survey questionnaire with patients andcitizens. We have created an advisory committee of 12 participants. Along withthe research team, they created a 36-question survey. They also suggested doingfocus groups to add data to the survey by reaching marginalized groups that aretraditionally excluded from digital health research. We also wanted to know theexperience of the participants being included in this study. We conductedinterviews and did a small survey with them. They appreciated being included fromthe beginning of the research, being listened to, and being respected. Theyappreciated the creativity of the group and the brainstorming sessions. However, they would have liked the tasks to be clearer from the start. They also wouldhave preferred to have more time in the brainstorming sessions to create thesurvey questions, and to have discussions outside of the meetings. The inclusion of patients and citizens is the main strength of this project. To improve theirintegration in health research, there needs to be good communication of projectobjectives. Also, meetings must be well organized, and participants must be able to evaluate their experience.

LID - 10.1186/s12859-022-04862-0 [doi]
AB  - Although there have been some recent cell and animal experiments indicating that expression of the gene encoding apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalyticsubunit 3B (APOBEC3B) is closely related to cancer, it still lacks pan-canceranalysis. Here we analyzed the potential carcinogenic role of APOBEC3B in 33tumors based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). APOBEC3B was highly expressed in most tumors and weakly expressed in a few. Differences in expression level weresignificantly correlated with the pathological tumor stage and prognosis ofaffected patients. The high-frequency APOBEC3B changes were principally mutationsand amplifications in some tumors, such as uterine corpus endometrial carcinomas or cutaneous melanomas. In testicular germ cell tumors and invasive breastcarcinomas, APOBEC3B expression and CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts were correlated.In other cancers, such as human papilloma virus (HPV)-related head and necksquamous cell carcinomas or esophageal adenocarcinomas, there was alsocancer-associated fibroblast infiltration. The APOBEC3B enzyme acts in themitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain and in oxidativephosphorylation. This first pan-cancer study provides a comprehensiveunderstanding of the multiple roles of APOBEC3B in different tumor types.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer affecting women and is caused by human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections that are sexually transmitted.There are currently commercially available prophylactic vaccines that have beenshown to protect vaccinated individuals against HPV infections, however, thesevaccines have no therapeutic effects for those who are previously infected withthe virus. The current study's aim was to use immunoinformatics to develop amulti-epitope vaccine with therapeutic potential against cervical cancer.RESULTS: In this study, T-cell epitopes from E5 and E7 proteins of HPV16/18 were predicted. These epitopes were evaluated and chosen based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, and induction of IFN-gamma production (only in helper T lymphocytes). Then, the selected epitopes were sequentially linked by appropriatelinkers. In addition, a C-terminal fragment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis heatshock protein 70 (HSP70) was used as an adjuvant for the vaccine construct. Thephysicochemical parameters of the vaccine construct were acceptable. Furthermore,the vaccine was soluble, highly antigenic, and non-allergenic. The vaccine's 3Dmodel was predicted, and the structural improvement after refinement wasconfirmed using the Ramachandran plot and ProSA-web. The vaccine's B-cellepitopes were predicted. Molecular docking analysis showed that the vaccine'srefined 3D model had a strong interaction with the Toll-like receptor 4. Thestructural stability of the vaccine construct was confirmed by molecular dynamicssimulation. Codon adaptation was performed in order to achieve efficient vaccine expression in Escherichia coli strain K12 (E. coli). Subsequently, in silicocloning of the multi-epitope vaccine was conducted into pET-28a ( +) expressionvector. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of bioinformatics analyses, themulti-epitope vaccine is structurally stable, as well as a non-allergic andnon-toxic antigen. However, in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validatethe vaccine's efficacy and safety. If satisfactory results are obtained from invitro and in vivo studies, the vaccine designed in this study may be effective asa therapeutic vaccine against cervical cancer.

TI  - Molecular characterization of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus isolated in Chilereveals several mutations in VP2 coding region and a reassortment in its genome.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09956-x [doi]
AB  - Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) is a well-described disease in young chickens. Itis caused by the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV), which has abi-segmented, double-strand RNA genome. The absence of a lipidic envelope makesIBDV highly resistant to environmental conditions. Consequently, it is widelyreported around the world. Fourteen samples retrieved from chickens exhibitingapparent alterations of the bursa of Fabricius between 2017 and 2021 wereincluded in the study. These samples were passaged into embryonated eggs and the presence of IBD was confirmed through RT-PCR. The PCR products were sequenced andanalyzed to characterize the Chilean IBDV isolates for comparison with GenBanksequences, including vaccines sequences currently used in Chile.Phylogeneticanalysis classified the Chilean sequences as A1B1, except the sample15002_CL_2021 which was classified as A2B1. On the other hand, all Chileanviruses were grouped as B1, based on viral segment B. Estimated evolutionarydivergence between different genogroups supports these clustering. Moreover,samples 13936_CL_2017, 14038_CL_2017, 14083_CL_2017, 14145_CL_2018,14431_CL_2019, and 14459_CL_2019 showed high similitude with the D78 and ViBursa CE vaccines (both currently used in Chile). Viruses 14010_CL_2018, 14040_CL_2017,14514_CL_2019 and 14019_CL_2017 exhibited patterns that do not exactly fit eithervaccine. Finally, viruses 15,041 N-_CL_2021, 15,041 N+_CL_2021, and 15004_CL_2021showed even more differences regarding both vaccines.This is the first study inChile to analyze the genetic sequences of IBDV isolates. The differentassessments conducted as part of the study suggest a close relationship withvaccines currently in use. Interestingly, one of the viruses exhibited areassortment in its genome segments, which could confer new characteristics tothe virus. However, new approaches would be required to establish the origin ofthe isolated viruses, as well as how the recombination is changing its virulence or morbidity.

PG  - 13264
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17058-6 [doi]
AB  - PILRA (rs1859788 A > G) has been suggested to be a protective variant forAlzheimer's disease (AD) and is an entry co-receptor for herpes simplex virus-1. We conducted a nested case-control study of 360 1:1-matched AD subjects.Interactions between the PILRA-A allele, APOE risk variants (epsilon3/epsilon4 orepsilon4/epsilon4) and GM17 for AD risk were modelled. The associations werecross-validated using two independent whole-genome sequencing datasets. We found negative interactions between PILRA-A and GM17 (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-1.00) andbetween PILRA-A and APOE risk variants (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.98) in thediscovery dataset. In the replication cohort, a joint effect of PILRA and PILRA xGM 17/17 was observed for the risk of developing AD (p .02). Here, we report anegative effect modification by PILRA on APOE and GM17 high-risk variants forfuture AD risk in two independent datasets. This highlights the complex genetics of AD.

TI  - Viral biogeography of the mammalian gut and parenchymal organs.
LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01178-w [doi]
AB  - The mammalian virome has been linked to health and disease but our understanding of how it is structured along the longitudinal axis of the mammaliangastrointestinal tract (GIT) and other organs is limited. Here, we report ametagenomic analysis of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic virome occupying luminaland mucosa-associated habitats along the GIT, as well as parenchymal organs(liver, lung and spleen), in two representative mammalian species, the domesticpig and rhesus macaque (six animals per species). Luminal samples from the large intestine of both mammals harboured the highest loads and diversity ofbacteriophages (class Caudoviricetes, family Microviridae and others). Mucosalsamples contained much lower viral loads but a higher proportion of eukaryoticviruses (families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae). Parenchymal organs contained bacteriophages of gut origin, in addition to some eukaryotic viruses.Overall, GIT virome composition was specific to anatomical region and hostspecies. Upper GIT and mucosa-specific viruses were greatly under-represented in distal colon samples (a proxy for faeces). Nonetheless, certain viral and phagespecies were ubiquitous in all samples from the oral cavity to the distal colon. The dataset and its accompanying methodology may provide an important resourcefor future work investigating the biogeography of the mammalian gut virome.

TI  - Trafficked Malayan pangolins contain viral pathogens of humans.
LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01181-1 [doi]
AB  - Pangolins are the most trafficked wild animal in the world according to the WorldWildlife Fund. The discovery of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayanpangolins has piqued interest in the viromes of these wild, scaly-skinnedmammals. We sequenced the viromes of 161 pangolins that were smuggled into China and assembled 28 vertebrate-associated viruses, 21 of which have not beenpreviously reported in vertebrates. We named 16 members of Hunnivirus, Pestivirusand Copiparvovirus pangolin-associated viruses. We report that the L-protein has been lost from all hunniviruses identified in pangolins. Sequences of fourhuman-associated viruses were detected in pangolin viromes, including respiratorysyncytial virus, Orthopneumovirus, Rotavirus A and Mammalian orthoreovirus. Thegenomic sequences of five mammal-associated and three tick-associated viruseswere also present. Notably, a coronavirus related to HKU4-CoV, which wasoriginally found in bats, was identified. The presence of these viruses insmuggled pangolins identifies these mammals as a potential source of emergentpathogenic viruses.

AB  - Many countries have secured larger quantities of COVID-19 vaccines than theirpopulation is willing to take. The abundance and the large variety of vaccinescreated not only an unprecedented intensity of vaccine related public discourse, but also a historical moment to understand vaccine hesitancy better. Yet, theheterogeneity of hesitancy by vaccine types has been neglected in the existingliterature so far. We address this problem by analysing the acceptance and theassessment of five vaccine types. We use information collected with a nationally representative survey at the end of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic inHungary. During the vaccination campaign, individuals could reject the assignedvaccine to wait for a more preferred alternative that enables us to quantifyrevealed preferences across vaccine types. We find that hesitancy is heterogenousby vaccine types and is driven by individuals' trusted source of information.Believers of conspiracy theories are more likely to evaluate the mRNA vaccines(Pfizer and Moderna) unacceptable. Those who follow the advice of politicians aremore likely to evaluate vector-based (AstraZeneca and Sputnik) or whole-virusvaccines (Sinopharm) acceptable. We argue that the greater selection of availablevaccine types and the free choice of the individual are desirable conditions toincrease the vaccination rate in societies.

AB  - The study aims to determine the selected miRNAs expression in milk somatic cells (MSC) and blood leukocytes (BL) of SRLV-seronegative (SRLV-SN) andSRLV-seropositive (SRLV-SP) goats. A functional in silico analysis of theirtarget genes was also conducted. MiR-93-5p and miR-30e-5p were expressed only in BL, while miR-144 was expressed only in MSC, regardless of SRLV infection. In theSRLV-SP goats, higher miR-214-3p and miR-221-5p levels were found in the MSC thanin the BL. Only miR-30e-5p was influenced by the lactation stage in BL in bothgroups, while only miR-93-5p was altered in BL of SRLV-SN goats. The target gene protein products exhibited contradictory functions, protecting the host fromvirus on the one hand and assisting viruses in their life cycle on the other. Thedifferential expression of the miRNAs observed between the MSC and BL of SRLV-SP goats may suggest that the local immune response to the infection in the udderdiffers from the systemic response, and acts independently. Some miRNAsdemonstrated different expression between lactation stages. It may be influenced by the metabolic burden occurring in early lactation and its peak. Some of thestudied miRNAs may influence viral infection by regulating the expression oftheir target genes.

AB  - First identified in 1947, Zika virus took roughly 70 years to cause a pandemicunusually associated with virus-induced brain damage in newborns. Zika virus istransmitted by mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti, and secondarily, Aedesalbopictus, both colonizing a large strip encompassing tropical and temperateregions. As part of the international project ZIKAlliance initiated in 2016, 50mosquito populations from six species collected in 12 countries wereexperimentally infected with different Zika viruses. Here, we show that Ae.aegypti is mainly responsible for Zika virus transmission having the highestsusceptibility to viral infections. Other species play a secondary role intransmission while Culex mosquitoes are largely non-susceptible. Zika strain isexpected to significantly modulate transmission efficiency with African strainsbeing more likely to cause an outbreak. As the distribution of Ae. aegypti willdoubtless expand with climate change and without new marketed vaccines, all theingredients are in place to relive a new pandemic of Zika.

TI  - Regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in health and diseases: from mechanisms to targeted therapeutics.
PG  - 265
LID - 10.1038/s41392-022-01125-5 [doi]
AB  - Disturbed cholesterol homeostasis plays critical roles in the development ofmultiple diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), neurodegenerativediseases and cancers, particularly the CVD in which the accumulation of lipids(mainly the cholesteryl esters) within macrophage/foam cells underneath theendothelial layer drives the formation of atherosclerotic lesions eventually.More and more studies have shown that lowering cholesterol level, especiallylow-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, protects cardiovascular system andprevents cardiovascular events effectively. Maintaining cholesterol homeostasisis determined by cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake, efflux, transport, storage,utilization, and/or excretion. All the processes should be precisely controlledby the multiple regulatory pathways. Based on the regulation of cholesterolhomeostasis, many interventions have been developed to lower cholesterol byinhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake or enhancing cholesterolutilization and excretion. Herein, we summarize the historical review andresearch events, the current understandings of the molecular pathways playing keyroles in regulating cholesterol homeostasis, and the cholesterol-loweringinterventions in clinics or in preclinical studies as well as newcholesterol-lowering targets and their clinical advances. More importantly, wereview and discuss the benefits of those interventions for the treatment ofmultiple diseases including atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, obesity,diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases,osteoporosis and virus infection.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality inchildren, due in part to their distinct immune system, characterized by impaired induction of Th 1 immunity. Here we show application of cationic adjuvantformulation CAF08, a liposomal vaccine formulation tailored to induce Th 1immunity in early life via synergistic engagement of Toll-like Receptor 7/8 andthe C-type lectin receptor Mincle. We apply quantitative phosphoproteomics tohuman dendritic cells and reveal a role for Protein Kinase C-delta for enhancedTh1 cytokine production in neonatal dendritic cells and identify signaling eventsresulting in antigen cross-presentation. In a murine in vivo model a singleimmunization at birth with CAF08-adjuvanted RSV pre-fusion antigen protectsnewborn mice from RSV infection by induction of antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cellsand Th1 cells. Overall, we describe a pediatric adjuvant formulation andcharacterize its mechanism of action providing a promising avenue for developmentof early life vaccines against RSV and other respiratory viral pathogens.

TI  - Targeted enzymatic VLP-nanoreactors with beta-glucocerebrosidase activity aspotential enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease.
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.202200384 [doi]
AB  - Gaucher disease is a genetic disorder and the most common lysosomal diseasecaused by the deficiency of enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Althoughenzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is successfully applied using mannose-exposedconjugated glucocerebrosidase, the lower stability of the enzyme in blood demandsperiodically intravenous administration that adds to the high cost of thetreatment. In this work, the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase was encapsulatedinside virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) from brome mosaic virus (BMV), and theirsurface was functionalized with mannose groups to be targeted to macrophages. TheVLP nanoreactors showed significant GCase catalytic activity. Moreover, theMichaelis-Menten constants for the free GCase enzyme (KM = 0.29 mM) and thefunctionalized nanoreactors (KM = 0.32 mM) were similar even after chemicalmodification. Importantly, the stability of enzymes under physiologicalconditions (pH 7.4, 37 C) was enhanced by 11-fold after encapsulation that isbeneficial for obtaining higher blood circulation half-life, which may reduce thecost of therapy by reducing the requirement of multiple intravenous injections.Finally, the mannose receptor targeted enzymatic nanoreactors showed enhancedinternalization into macrophage cells. Thus, the catalytic activity and celltargeting suggest the potential of these nanoreactors in ERT of Gaucher'sdisease.

TI  - Host response dysregulations amongst adults hospitalized by influenza A H1N1virus pneumonia: A prospective multicenter cohort study.
LID - S0953-6205(22)00259-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2022.07.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited knowledge exists on how early host response impacts outcomes in influenza pneumonia. METHODS: This study assessed what was the contribution ofhost immune response at the emergency department on hospital mortality amongstadults with influenza A H1N1pdm09 pneumonia and whether early stratification byimmune host response anticipates the risk of death. This is a secondary analysis from a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort comparing 75 adultsrequiring intensive care with 38 hospitalized in medical wards. Different immune response biomarkers within 24 h of hospitalization and their association withhospital mortality were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-three were discharged alive.Non-survivors were associated (p<0.05) with lower lymphocytes (751 vs. 387),monocytes (450 vs. 220) expression of HLA-DR (1,662 vs. 962) and higher IgMlevels (178 vs. 152;p<0.01). Lymphocyte subpopulations amongst non-survivorsshowed a significantly (p<0.05) lower number of TCD3+ (247.2 vs. 520.8), TCD4+(150.3 vs. 323.6), TCD8+ (95.3 vs. 151.4) and NKCD56+ (21.9 vs. 91.4). Number of lymphocytes, monocytes and NKCD56+ predicted hospital mortality (AUC 0.854).Hospital mortality was independently associated with low HLA-DR values, lownumber of NKCD56+ cells, and high IgM levels, in a Cox-proportional hazardanalysis. A second model, documented that hospital mortality was independentlyassociated with a phenotype combining immunoparalysis with hyperinflammation (HR 5.53; 95%CI 2.16-14.14), after adjusting by predicted mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that amongst influenza pneumonia, presence of immunoparalysis was amajor mortality driver. Influenza heterogeneity was partly explained by earlyspecific host response dysregulations which should be considered to designpersonalized approaches of adjunctive therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Histologic tumor necrosis (TN) is a well-established independentprognostic indicator in patients treated surgically for clear cell renal cellcarcinoma (ccRCC). However, the precise mechanisms by which TN alters diseaseprogression remain unknown. The DEAD-box protein DDX41, a member of a largefamily of helicases, has been characterized as a pattern recognition receptoragainst an array of double-stranded (ds)DNA produced from bacteria, dsDNAviruses, and nearby cells that have released dsDNA fragments through necrosis. Wehypothesized that DDX41 expression may be upregulated in ccRCC with TN, leadingto worse prognosis. METHODS: Relationship between the presence of TN and DDX41expression were examined using The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets or using ccRCCsamples in our institution. Further, the molecular functions of DDX41 wereinvestigated with human ccRCC cells. RESULTS: The presence of TN wassignificantly associated with the upregulation of mRNA and protein expression of DDX41 in the 2different patient cohorts with ccRCC. In addition, the mRNA andprotein expression levels of DDX41 revealed a worse prognosis. In vitro analyses with ccRCC cells revealed that DDX41 expression promotes tumor-promotingactivity. Furthermore, VHL loss, 1of the most common features in ccRCC, was shownto play an extremely important role in increasing the expression of the CXCLfamily in DDX41-expressing ccRCC, leading to the acquisition of a worse malignantphenotype. CONCLUSIONS: DDX41 expression is associated with TN in ccRCC and leadsto a worse prognosis in cooperation with VHL loss.

TI  - Tumor suppressor p53 inhibits hepatitis C virus replication by inducingE6AP-mediated proteasomal degradation of the viral core protein.
LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.14461 [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in the host defense system againsthepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, although the detailed mechanism remainsunknown. Here, we found that p53 inhibits HCV replication by downregulating HCVCore protein levels in human hepatoma cells. For this effect, p53 potentiated therole of E6-associated protein (E6AP) as an E3 ligase to induce ubiquitination andproteasomal degradation of HCV Core. Specifically, p53 facilitated the binding ofE6AP to HCV Core through direct interactions with the two proteins. In addition, E6AP failed to induce ubiquitination of HCV Core in the absence of p53,suggesting that p53 increases the E3 ligase activity of E6AP in a triple complex consisting of p53, E6AP, and HCV Core.

TI  - Positive strand RNA viruses differ in the constraints they place on the foldingof their negative strand.

LID - 10.1261/rna.079125.122 [doi]
AB  - Genome replication of positive strand RNA viruses requires the production of acomplementary negative strand RNA that serves as a template for synthesis of morepositive strand progeny. Structural RNA elements are important for genomereplication, but while they are readily observed in the positive strand, evidenceof their existence in the negative strand is more limited. We hypothesised thatthis was due to viruses differing in their capacity to allow this latter RNA toadopt structural folds. To investigate this, ribozymes were introduced into thenegative strand of different viral constructs; the expectation being that if RNA folding occurred, negative strand cleavage and suppression of replication wouldbe seen. Indeed this was what happened with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and felinecalicivirus (FCV) constructs. However, little or no impact was observed forchikungunya virus (CHIKV), human rhinovirus (HRV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) andyellow fever virus (YFV) constructs. Reduced cleavage in the negative strandproved to be due to duplex formation with the positive strand. Interestingly,ribozyme-containing RNAs also remained intact when produced in vitro by the HCVpolymerase, again due to duplex formation. Overall, our results show that thereare important differences in the conformational constraints imposed on thefolding of the negative strand between different positive strand RNA viruses.

TI  - Inactivated genotype 1a, 2a and 3a HCV vaccine candidates induced broadlyneutralising antibodies in mice.
LID - gutjnl-2021-326323 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prophylactic vaccine is needed to control the HCV epidemic, withgenotypes 1-3 causing >80% of worldwide infections. Vaccine development ishampered by HCV heterogeneity, viral escape including protection of conservedneutralising epitopes and suboptimal efficacy of HCV cell culture systems. Wedeveloped cell culture-based inactivated genotype 1-3 HCV vaccine candidates topresent natively folded envelope proteins to elicit neutralising antibodies.DESIGN: High-yield genotype 1a, 2a and 3a HCV were developed by serial passage ofTNcc, J6cc and DBN3acc in Huh7.5 cells and engineering of acquired mutationsdetected by next-generation sequencing. Neutralising epitope exposure wasdetermined in cell-based neutralisation assays using human monoclonal antibodies AR3A and AR4A, and polyclonal antibody C211. BALB/c mice were immunised withprocessed and inactivated genotype 1a, 2a or 3a viruses using AddaVax, ahomologue of the licenced adjuvant MF-59. Purified mouse and patient serum IgGwere assayed for neutralisation capacity; mouse IgG and immune-sera were assayed for E1/E2 binding. RESULTS: Compared with the original viruses, high-yieldviruses had up to ~1000 fold increased infectivity titres (peak titres: 6-7 log10focus-forming units (FFU)/mL) and up to ~2470 fold increased exposure ofconserved neutralising epitopes. Vaccine-induced IgG broadly neutralised genotype1-6 HCV (EC50: 30-193 microg/mL; mean 71 microg/mL), compared favourably with IgGfrom chronically infected patients, and bound genotype 1-3 E1/E2; immune-seraendpoint titres reached up to 32 000. CONCLUSION: High-yield genotype 1-3 HCVcould be developed as basis for inactivated vaccine candidates inducing broadlyneutralising antibodies in mice supporting further preclinical development.

TI  - Characterization and cross-protection of experimental infections with SeCoV andtwo PEDV variants.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14674 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the infection of weaned pigs with swineenteric coronavirus (SeCoV) -a chimeric virus most likely originated from arecombination event between porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) andtransmissible gastroenteritis virus, or its mutant porcine respiratorycoronavirus-, and two PEDV G1b variants, including a recently describedrecombinant PEDV-SeCoV (rPEDV-SeCoV), as well as to determine the degree ofcross-protection achieved against the rPEDV-SeCoV. For this purpose, forty-eight 4-week-old weaned pigs were randomly allocated into four groups of 12 animals;piglets within each group were primary inoculated with one of the investigatedviral strains (B: PEDV; C: SeCoV and D: rPEDV-SeCoV) or mock-inoculated (A), and exposed to rPEDV-SeCOV at day 20 post-infection; thus, group A was primarychallenged (-/rPEDV-SeCoV), groups B and C were subjected to a heterologousre-challenge (PEDV/rPEDV-SeCoV and SeCoV/rPEDV-SeCoV, respectively), and group D to a homologous re-challenge (rPEDV-SeCoV/rPEDV-SeCoV), Clinical signs, viralshedding, microscopic lesions and specific humoral and cellular immune responses (IgG, IgA, neutralizing antibodies and IgA and IFN-gamma-secreting cells) weremonitored. After primo-infection all three viral strains induced anundistinguishable mild-to-moderate clinical disease with diarrhea as the mainsign and villus shortening lesions in the small intestine. In homologousre-challenged pigs, no clinical signs or lesions were observed, and viralshedding was only detected in a single animal. This fact may be explained by the significant high level of rPEDV-SeCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies found inthese pigs before the challenge. In contrast, prior exposure to a different PEDV G1b variant or SeCoV only provided partial cross-protection, allowing rPEDV-SeCoVreplication and shedding in feces.

AB  - Dyslipidemia, specifically elevated LDL cholesterol levels, causesatherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and increases the risk ofmyocardial infarction and stroke. Statins, a class of drugs that exert theireffects by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis ofcholesterol, have been the mainstay of therapy for the primary prevention ofcardiovascular disease and lipids reduction. Statins are associated with sideeffects, most commonly myopathy and myalgias, despite their proven efficacy. Thisreview explores non-statin lipid-lowering therapies and examines recent advances and emerging research. Over the previous decades, several lipid-loweringtherapies, both as monotherapy and adjuncts to statin therapy and lipid-targetinggene therapy, have emerged, thus redefining how we treat dyslipidemia. Thesedrugs include Bile acids sequestrants, Fibrates, Nicotinic acid, Ezetimibe,Bempedoic acid, Volanesoren, Evinacumab, and the PCSK 9 Inhibitors Evolocumab andAlirocumab. Emerging gene-based therapy includes Small interfering RNAs,Antisense oligonucleotides, Adeno-associated virus vectors, CRISPR/Cas9 basedtherapeutics, and Non-coding RNA therapy. Of all these therapies, Bempedoic acid works most like statins by working through a similar pathway to decreasecholesterol levels. However, it is not associated with myopathy. Overall,although statins continue to be the gold standard, non-statin therapies are setto play an increasingly important role in managing dyslipidemia.

AB  - Marek's disease virus (MDV), a highly contagious cell associated virus, is theetiological agent of Marek's disease (MD), a lymphoproliferative and neuropathic disease of domestic chickens. Clinical signs of MD include transient paralysis,bursal/thymic atrophy, and T cell lymphomas. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are shortsingle-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by transcriptional suppression or mRNA degradation. Herpesviruses, including MDV, encode for miRNAs that are known to play essential roles in viral pathogenicity, oncogenesis, andevasion of immune responses. In this study, we performed miRNA sequencing inthymuses of control and MDV-infected chickens of MD-resistant (63) andsusceptible (72) lines at 21 days post infection (dpi). The thymus is a lymphoid organ that undergoes severe atrophy due to MDV-induced apoptotic mediateddestruction of T cells. Sequence analysis identified 658 total chicken miRNAs in the thymuses of control and MDV-infected birds of both lines. Of these, 453 were novel and 205 were known microRNAs. All novel miRNAs mapped to chicken genomewith no sequence homology to existing miRNAs in the chicken miRbase. Comparative analysis between the thymuses of control and infected birds of resistant andsusceptible lines identified 78 differentially expressed microRNAs that mightprovide insights into mechanisms of thymus atrophy.

AB  - The frequently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have weakened the effectiveness ofexisting COVID-19 vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapy. Nevertheless, theinfections of SARS-CoV-2 variants still depend on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) receptor-mediated cell entry, and thus the soluble human ACE2 (shACE2) is a potential decoy for broadly blocking SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, wefirstly generated the recombinant AAVrh10-vectored shACE2 constructs, a kind ofadeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype with pulmonary tissue tropism, and thenvalidated its inhibition capacity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. To furtheroptimize the minimized ACE2 functional domain candidates, a comprehensiveanalysis was performed to clarify the interactions between the ACE2 orthologsfrom various species and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike(S) protein. Based on the key interface amino acids, we designed a series oftruncated ACE2 orthologs, and then assessed their potential affinity to bind toSARS-CoV-2 variants RBD in silico. Of note, we found that the 24-83aa fragment ofdog ACE2 (dACE224-83) had a higher affinity to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 variantsthan that of human ACE2. Importantly, AAVrh10-vectored shACE2 or dACE224-83constructs exhibited a broadly blockage breadth against SARS-CoV-2 prototype and and variants in vitro and ex vivo. Collectively, these data highlighted apromising therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the control of human viralinfections but their activity is significantly impaired in patients infected withchronic hepatitis B (CHB). The mechanism that contributes to NK cell dysfunction in CHB needs further elucidation. In this study, we analyzed the expression andfunction of the novel inhibitory receptor immunoglobulin-like transcript-2 (ILT2)on NK cells from 131 CHB patients and 36 healthy controls. We observed that ILT2 expression on circulating CD56(dim)CD16(+)NK cells was increased inimmune-tolerant, immune-active and HBeAg-negative hepatitis patients comparedwith inactive carriers and controls. The frequency of ILT2(+)CD56(dim)NK cellswas positively correlated with serum viral load in immune-tolerant patients. The percentage of ILT2(+)CD56(dim)NK cells decreased along with HBV load in CHBpatients who received antiviral therapy. Functional analysis showed thatILT2(+)CD56(dim)NK cells in CHB patients had significantly reduced degranulation and IFN-gamma production. Upregulation of ILT2 was associated with high levels ofapoptosis in CD56(dim)CD16(+)NK cells from CHB patients. ILT2 blockade was shown to increase the cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production of CD56(dim)NK cells insome CHB patients. Finally, ILT2 was found to be moderately upregulated byTGF-beta1, which was increased in immune-tolerant, immune-active andHBeAg-negative hepatitis patients. Our results show that chronic HBV infectionincreases the levels of the inhibitory receptor ILT2 on CD56(dim)NK cells andinhibits their functions, providing a new mechanism of NK-cell disability in CHB patients.

AB  - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, new variants have continuously emerged andspread in populations. Among these, variants of concern (VOC) have been the main culprits of successive epidemic waves, due to their transmissibility,pathogenicity or ability to escape the immune response. Quantification of theSARS-CoV-2 genomes in raw wastewater is a reliable approach well-described andwidely deployed worldwide to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humanpopulations connected to sewage systems. Discrimination of VOCs in wastewater is also a major issue and can be achieved by genome sequencing or by detection ofspecific mutations suggesting the presence of VOCs. This study aimed to date the emergence of these VOCs (from Alpha to Omicron BA.2) by monitoring wastewaterfrom the greater Paris area, France, but also to model the propagation dynamicsof these VOCs and to characterize the replacement kinetics of the prevalentpopulations. These dynamics were compared to various individual-centered publichealth data, such as regional incidence and the proportions of VOCs identified bysequencing of strains isolated from patient. The viral dynamics in wastewaterhighlighted the impact of the vaccination strategy on the viral circulationwithin human populations but also suggested its potential effect on the selectionof variants most likely to be propagated in immunized populations. Normalization of concentrations to capture population movements appeared statistically morereliable using variations in local drinking water consumption rather than usingPMMoV concentrations because PMMoV fecal shedding was subject to variability and was not sufficiently relevant in this study. The dynamics of viral spread wasobserved earlier (about 13days on the wave related to Omicron VOC) in rawwastewater than the regional incidence alerting to a possible risk ofdecorrelation between incidence and actual virus circulation probably resultingfrom a lower severity of infection in vaccinated populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma patients often suffer from frequent respiratory viralinfections and reduced virus clearance. Lung resident memory T cells providerapid protection against viral re-infections. OBJECTIVE: As development ofresident memory T cells relies on the lung microenvironment, we investigated the impact of allergen sensitisation on the development of virus-specific lungresident memory T cells and viral clearance. METHODS: Mice were sensitised withhouse dust mite extract followed by priming with X47 and a subsequent secondaryinfluenza infection. Anti-viral memory T cell responses and protection to viralinfection was assessed pre- and post-secondary influenza infection, respectively.Gene set variation analysis was performed on datasets from U-BIOPRED asthmacohort using an IFN-induced epithelial cell signature and a tissue residentmemory T cell signature. RESULTS: Viral loads were higher in lungs of sensitised compared to non-sensitised mice post-secondary infection, indicating reducedvirus clearance. X47 priming induced fewer anti-viral lung resident memory CD8 T cells and resulted in lower pulmonary IFN levels in the lungs of sensitised ascompared to non-sensitised mice. Using data from the U-BIOPRED cohort, we foundthat patients with enrichment of epithelial IFN-induced genes in nasal brushings and bronchial biopsies were also enriched in TRM associated genes, had moreepithelial CD8 T cells and reported significantly fewer exacerbations.CONCLUSION: The allergen sensitised lung microenvironment interferes with theformation of anti-viral resident memory CD8 T cells in lungs and virus clearance.Defective anti-viral memory response might contribute to increased susceptibilityof asthma patients to viral exacerbations.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is a chronic diseasewithout a known cure. The advent of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) hasenabled people with HIV (PWH) to have significantly prolonged life expectancies. As a result, morbidity and mortality associated with HIV-1 infection havedeclined considerably. However, these individuals experience chronic systemicinflammation whose multifaceted etiology is associated with other numerouscomorbidities. Inflammasomes are vital mediators that contribute to inflammatory signaling in HIV-1 infection. Here, we provide an overview of the inflammatorypathway that underlies HIV-1 infection, explicitly highlighting the role of theNLRP3 inflammasome. We also delineate the current literature on inflammasomes andthe therapeutic targeting strategies aimed at the NLRP3 inflammasome to moderate HIV-1 infection-associated inflammation. Here we describe the NLRP3 inflammasome as a key pathway in developing novel therapeutic targets to block HIV-1replication and HIV-1-associated inflammatory signaling. Controlling theinflammatory pathways is critical in alleviating the morbidities and mortalityassociated with chronic HIV-1 infection in PWH.

AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the most concerning pathogens inpenaeid shrimp and can cause severe loss in shrimp aquaculture worldwide. Amongthe WSSV structural proteins, VP15, a DNA-binding protein located in the WSSVnucleocapsid, is an antiviral protein candidate to protect kuruma shrimp(Marsupenaeus japonicus) from WSSV infection. We identified that the truncatedVP15, VP15(26-57), is responsible for the protective effect against the WSSV.This study attempts to develop an immunizing agent against WSSV using silkwormpupa as a delivery vector through oral administration. The VP15, VP15(26-57), andSR11 peptide derived from VP15(26-57) were expressed in silkworm pupae. Oraladministration of feed mixed with the powdered pupae that expressed VP15-derived constructs enhanced the survivability of kuruma shrimp with an overall relativepercent survival (RPS) higher than 70%. There is no death for the group receivingpupa/VP15(26-57), and the RPS is 100%. In addition, we also investigated therelative mRNA expression levels of immune-related genes by qPCR at different timepoints. Our results indicate that the oral administration of pupa/VP15-derivedproducts could provide a high protective effect against WSSV and be a practicalapproach for controlling WSSV in aquaculture.

AB  - A role for ferroptosis in articular cartilage destruction associated withrheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been identified. We previously reportedtransient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) expression was correlated with RA cartilage destruction. Herein, we further characterized a role for TRPM7 inchondrocyte ferroptosis. The expression of TRPM7 was found to be elevated inarticular chondrocytes derived from adjuvant arthritis (AA) rats, human RApatients, and cultured chondrocytes treated with the ferroptosis inducer,erastin. TRPM7 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition protected primary ratarticular chondrocytes and human chondrocytes (C28/I2 cells) from ferroptosis.Moreover, TRPM7 channel activity was demonstrated to contribute to chondrocyteferroptosis by elevation of intracellular Ca(2+). Mechanistically, thePKCalpha-NOX4 axis was found to respond to stimulation with erastin, whichresulted in TRPM7-mediated chondrocyte ferroptosis. Meanwhile, PKCalpha was shownto directly bind to NOX4, which could be reduced by TRPM7 channel inhibition.Adeno-associated virus 9-mediated TRPM7 silencing or TRPM7 blockade with 2-APBalleviated articular cartilage destruction in AA rats and inhibited chondrocyteferroptosis. Collectively, both genetic and pharmacological inhibitions of TRPM7 attenuated articular cartilage damage and chondrocyte ferroptosis via thePKCalpha-NOX4 axis, suggesting that TRPM7-mediated chondrocyte ferroptosis is apromising target for the prevention and treatment of RA.

AB  - The increased transmissibility of the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virusresulted in a rapid increase in infection among many psychiatric inpatients inour hospital between December 2021 and February 2022. This required ourinstitution to close affected units to new admissions. In response, weimplemented a model utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction(PCR) testing at the time of admission, the development of "admitting units"where all patients were quarantined for four days followed by repeat PCR testing,and subsequent transition to COVID-19 negative and COVID-19 positive "receivingunits" based on the results of the second test. No unit closures occurredfollowing full implementation of the model.

AB  - Rational detection of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial toprevention, control, and treatment of disease. Herein, a dual-wavelengthratiometric electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on resonance energytransfer (RET) between g-C3N4 nanosheets and Ru-SiO2@folic acid (FA)nanomaterials was designed to realize ultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2virus (RdRp gene). Firstly, the unique g-C3N4 nanosheets displayed very intenseand stable ECL at 460 nm, then the triple helix DNA was stably and verticallybound to g-C3N4 on electrode by high binding affinity between ssDNA and g-C3N4.Meanwhile, trace amounts of target genes were converted to a large number ofoutput by three-dimensional (3D) DNA walker multiple amplification, and theoutput bridged a multifunctional probe Ru-SiO2@FA to electrode. Ru-SiO2@FA notonly showed high ECL at 620 nm, but also effectively quenched g-C3N4 ECL. As aresult, ECL decreased at 460 nm and increased at 620 nm, which was used to designa rational ECL biosensor for detection of SARS gene. The results show that thebiosensor has excellent detection sensitivity for RdRp gene with a dynamicdetection range of 1 fM to 10 nM and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.18 fM. Thedual-wavelength ratio ECL biosensor has inestimable value and applicationprospects in the fields of biosensing and clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Clozapine has superior efficacy in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia;however, use of clozapine is limited due to severe side effects, includingmyocarditis. Using non-integrative Sendai virus, we generated induced pluripotentstem cell lines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two patients withrefractory schizophrenia, one clozapine-tolerant and one clozapine-inducedmyocarditis. Both cell lines exhibited a normal karyotype and pluripotency wasvalidated by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and their ability todifferentiate into the three germ layers. These lines can be used to generate 2D and 3D patient-specific human cellular models to identify the mechanism by which clozapine induces myocardial inflammation.

TI  - Omicron-associated changes in SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in the United Kingdom.

LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac613 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has been replaced by the highlytransmissible Omicron BA.1 variant, and subsequently by Omicron BA.2. It isimportant to understand how these changes in dominant variants affect reportedsymptoms, while also accounting for symptoms arising from other co-circulatingrespiratory viruses. METHODS: In a nationally representative UK community study, the COVID-19 Infection Survey, we investigated symptoms in PCR-positive infectionepisodes vs. PCR-negative study visits over calendar time, by age and vaccinationstatus, comparing periods when the Delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants weredominant. RESULTS: Between October-2020 and April-2022, 120,995 SARS-CoV-2PCR-positive episodes occurred in 115,886 participants, with 70,683 (58%)reporting symptoms. The comparator comprised 4,766,366 PCR-negative study visits (483,894 participants); 203,422 (4%) reporting symptoms. Symptom reporting inPCR-positives varied over time, with a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell asOmicron BA.1 dominated, maintained with BA.2 (44%/45% 17 October 2021, 16%/13% 2 January 2022, 15%/12% 27 March 2022). Cough, fever, shortness of breath, myalgia,fatigue/weakness and headache also decreased after Omicron BA.1 dominated, butsore throat increased, the latter to a greater degree than concurrent increasesin PCR-negatives. Fatigue/weakness increased again after BA.2 dominated, althoughto a similar degree to concurrent increases in PCR-negatives. Symptoms wereconsistently more common in adults aged 18-65 years than in children or olderadults. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in sore throat (also common in the generalcommunity), and a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell, make Omicron harder todetect with symptom-based testing algorithms, with implications for institutionaland national testing policies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The exact animal origin of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains obscure and understanding its host range isvital for preventing interspecies transmission. METHODS: Herein, we appliedsingle-cell sequencing to multiple tissues of 20 species (30 data sets) andintegrated them with public resources (45 data sets covering 26 species) toexpand the virus receptor distribution investigation. While the binding affinity between virus and receptor is essential for viral infectivity, understanding the receptor distribution could predict the permissive organs and tissues wheninfection occurs. RESULTS: Based on the transcriptomic data, the expressionprofiles of receptor or associated entry factors for viruses capable of causingrespiratory, blood, and brain diseases were described in detail. Conservedcellular connectomes and regulomes were also identified, revealing fundamentalcell-cell and gene-gene cross-talks from reptiles to humans. CONCLUSIONS:Overall, our study provides a resource of the single-cell atlas of the animalkingdom which could help to identify the potential host range and tissue tropism of viruses and reveal the host-virus co-evolution.

TI  - MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OF HAWAIIAN GEESE (BRANTA SANDVICENSIS) AND LAYSANALBATROSS (PHOEBASTRIA IMMUTABILIS) ASSOCIATED WITH RETICULOENDOTHELIOSIS VIRUS.
LID - 10.7589/JWD-D-21-00164 [doi]
AB  - Only one virus, Avipox, has been documented previously in wild birds in Hawaii.Using immunohistochemistry and PCR, we found that two native threatened Hawaiian Geese (Branta sandvicensis), one with multicentric histiocytoma and the otherwith toxoplasmosis, and one Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) with avianpox were infected with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). The virus was isolated from one of the geese by cell culture. Surveys of other Hawaiian geese withvarious pathologies, avian pox cases, and pox viral isolates using PCR failed to reveal REV, suggesting that the virus is uncommon, at least in samples examined. The full genome of the Gag, Pol, and Env genes were sequenced for all threeinfected birds and revealed geographic divergence of the Pol gene, suggesting it to be under strong selective pressure. Our finding of REV in Hawaii makes thisonly the second virus documented in native Hawaiian birds associated withpathology. Moreover, the presence of REV in a pelagic seabird is unusual. Future surveys should seek the reservoir of the virus in efforts to trace its origins.

PG  - e2202371119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2202371119 [doi]
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of the world's adult populationand accounts for a significant cancer burden of epithelial and B cell origins.Glycoprotein B (gB) is the primary fusogen essential for EBV entry into hostcells. Here, we isolated two EBV gB-specific neutralizing antibodies, 3A3 and3A5; both effectively neutralized the dual-tropic EBV infection of B andepithelial cells. In humanized mice, both antibodies showed effective protection from EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disorders. Cryoelectron microscopy analyses identified that 3A3 and 3A5 bind to nonoverlapping sites on domains D-II andD-IV, respectively. Structure-based mutagenesis revealed that 3A3 and 3A5 inhibitmembrane fusion through different mechanisms involving the interference withgB-cell interaction and gB activation. Importantly, the 3A3 and 3A5 epitopes are major targets of protective gB-specific neutralizing antibodies elicited bynatural EBV infection in humans, providing potential targets for antiviraltherapies and vaccines.

AB  - How does the COVID-19 pandemic affect interpersonal trust? Most evidence showsthat natural disasters reinforce trust and cooperation, but the COVID-19 virusdiffers from other calamities, since it spreads through contact with people,potentially increasing suspicion and distrust, as, according to contemporaneouswriters' accounts, seems to have been the case with the Black Death, the Londonplague, and the Spanish influenza. We investigate the link between interpersonal trust and individuals exposed to COVID-19, either vicariously through theircommunity or networks or directly by becoming infected. We rely on an originalpanel survey, including a survey experiment, with a representative sample ofadults in Italy, one of the countries hardest struck by the pandemic. Ourexperimental findings reveal that priming people about the risk that the pandemicposes to their health leads to a substantial increase in their trust instrangers. Our panel data analysis of within-individual effects shows that those who become infected trust strangers more than those who are not infected. Ourfindings could be explained by people observing higher than expected altruisticbehavior or becoming more dependent on other people's support, consistent withthe "emancipation theory of trust." When people recover from COVID-19, however,they drop to trusting strangers as much as those who were not directly exposed tothe virus, an indication that the positive effects on trust during the pandemichave an emotional source. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that, in theaggregate, there has been a small but significant increase in trust among thegeneral population relative to prepandemic levels.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010666 [doi]
AB  - Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection is commonlyreported in countries of Northeast Asia including China, Japan and South Korea.The majority of the SFTS patients are elderly and the average fatality rate ismore than 10%. A rapid and sensitive diagnostic method to monitor and preventSFTSV transmission remains an urgent clinical challenge. In this study, wedeveloped a molecular diagnostic technique for detection of SFTSV using theCRISPR-Cas12a system combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymeraseamplification (RT-RPA). Using this method, we successfully diagnosed SFTSVinfections with the reaction time of 50 min from blood plasma withoutcross-reactivity to other viruses, supporting its application for rapid andsensitive diagnosis of SFTS.

TI  - The effect of a temperature-sensitive prophage on the evolution of virulence inan opportunistic bacterial pathogen.
LID - 10.1111/mec.16638 [doi]
AB  - Viruses are key actors of ecosystems and have major impacts on globalbiogeochemical cycles. Prophages deserve particular attention as they areubiquitous in bacterial genomes and can enter a lytic cycle when triggered byenvironmental conditions. We explored how temperature affects the interactionsbetween prophages and other biological levels by using an opportunistic pathogen,the bacterium Serratia marcescens, that harbours several prophages and that hadundergone an evolution experiment under several temperature regimes. We foundthat the release of one of the prophages was temperature-sensitive and malleable to evolutionary changes. We further discovered that the virulence of thebacterium in an insect model also evolved and was positively correlated withphage release rates. We determined through analysis of genetic and epigeneticdata that changes in the bacterial outer cell wall structure possibly explainthis phenomenon. We hypothezise that the temperature-dependent phage release rateacted as a selection pressure on S. marcescens and that it resulted in modifiedbacterial virulence in the insect host. Our study system illustrates how viruses can mediate the inuence of abiotic environmental changes to other biologicallevels and thus be involved in ecosystem feedback loops.

AB  - Baicalin, a flavonoid compound extracted from the dry root of Scutellariabaicalensis Georgi, has been shown to have anti-inflammation, anti-viral,anti-bacterial, and immunomodulatory activity. However, the effect of baicalinagainst avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains unknown. The purpose ofthis study was to investigate the anti-IBV activity and underlying mechanism ofbaicalin in vitro. The results showed that baicalin has a direct virucidal effectbut no prophylactic effect on IBV infection. The mRNA and protein of IBV N weredecreased obviously when IBV-infected cells were treated with baicalin during themultiple stages of the virus replication cycle, including viral adsorption,invasion, internalization, and release. Stress granule (SG) formation resultedfrom the increase of G3BP1 and the phosphorylation of the PKR/eIF2alpha due tothe treatment of IBV-infected cells with baicalin. The inhibitory activity ofbaicalin on IBV replication was increased when G3BP1 expression was inhibited,and the down-regulation of G3BP1 expression occurred when the expression of PKRand eIF2alpha was inhibited. These findings revealed that baicalin activatesphosphorylation of PKR/eIF2alpha pathway and induces SG formation by targetingG3BP1, initiating the antiviral response to suppress IBV replication on Verocell. The results suggest that baicalin is a promising candidate drug to treat orprevent IBV infection.

TI  - Cancer Incidence Among Adults With HIV in a Population-Based Cohort in Korea.
PG  - e2224897
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.24897 [doi]
AB  - Importance: In combination with a decreased risk of AIDS-defining cancers andimproved survival of people infected with HIV, the burden of non-AIDS-definingcancer has increased markedly. Although a substantial number of studies havemeasured the cancer risk among people with HIV in developed countries, littleresearch has been conducted on the risk of cancer in HIV-infected people in Asia.Objective: To examine the cancer incidence and the estimated risk of cancer amongpeople in Korea infected with HIV compared with the general population. Design,Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study evaluated patientswithout cancer newly diagnosed with HIV from January 1, 2006, to December 31,2018, using a nationwide population-based claims database embedded in theNational Health Insurance Service database. Data were analyzed between December6, 2021, and February 28, 2022. Exposures: Infection with HIV. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cancer incidence and standardized incidence rate (SIR) through indirectstandardization. Results: A total of 11552 individuals without cancer (10444 male[90.4%]; mean [SD] age, 39.9 [11.2] years) diagnosed with HIV were identified.The SIR for all cancers was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.50-1.87) in men and 1.26 (95% CI,0.89-1.64) in women. In men, the highest SIRs were for Kaposi sarcoma (SIR,349.10; 95% CI, 196.10-502.20) and anal cancer (SIR, 104.20; 95% CI,55.56-149.90). The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 15.62; 95% CI,11.85-19.39), Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 16.67; 95% CI, 4.32-29.02), andoropharyngeal cancer (SIR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.36-4.58) in men infected with HIV was higher than in the general population. In women infected with HIV, an increasedincidence of cervical cancer (SIR, 4.98; 95% CI, 1.29-8.66) and non-Hodgkinlymphoma (SIR, 11.78; 95% CI, 2.35-21.21) compared with the general populationwas observed. The SIR of thyroid cancer in patients with HIV was lower than inthe general population in both men (SIR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.27-0.99) and women (SIR,0.48; 95% CI, 0.06-0.90). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, cancerrisks, especially AIDS-defining cancer and virus-related cancer, were elevated inpeople with HIV. Efforts for cancer prevention, screening, and betteraccessibility to medical care in HIV-infected people are warranted.

TI  - Rapid and quantitative detection of multiple antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 mutantproteins by photo-immobilized microarray.
LID - 10.1007/s44211-022-00161-z [doi]
AB  - A rapid automatic quantitative diagnostic system for multiple SARS-CoV-2 mutantprotein-specific antibodies was developed using a microarray with photoreactivepolymers. Two types of photoreactive polymers, phenylazide and polyoxyethylene,were prepared. The polymers were coated on a plastic plate. Aqueous solutions of mutant virus proteins were microspotted on the coated plate and immobilized byphotoirradiation. Virus-specific IgG in the serum or blood was automaticallyassayed using an instrument that we developed for pipetting, reagent stirring,and washing. The results highly correlated with those of the conventionalenzyme-linked immunoassay or immunochromatography. This system was successfullyused to test the sera or blood from the patients recovered from the infection andthe vaccinated individuals. The recovered individuals had antibodies against the nucleoprotein, in contrast to the vaccinated individuals. The amount ofantibodies produced decreased with an increase in virus mutation. Blood collectedfrom the fingertip (5 muL) and a test period of 8 min were sufficient conditions for conducting multiple antibody assays. We believe that our system wouldfacilitate rapid and quantitative automatic assays and aid in the diagnosis ofvarious viral infectious diseases and assessment of the immune status forclinical applications.

TI  - A Review of In Silico Research, SARS-CoV-2, and Neurodegeneration: Focus onPapain-Like Protease.
LID - 10.1007/s12640-022-00542-2 [doi]
AB  - Since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, the search for new approaches to treat this disease took place in the scientific community. The insilico approach has gained importance at this moment, once the methodologies usedin this kind of study allow for the identification of specific protein-ligandinteractions, which may serve as a filter step for molecules that can act asspecific inhibitors. In addition, it is a low-cost and high-speed technology.Molecular docking has been widely used to find potential viral protein inhibitorsfor structural and non-structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, aiming to block theinfection and the virus multiplication. The papain-like protease (PLpro)participates in the proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV-2 and composes one of the main targets studied for pharmacological intervention by in silico methodologies.Based on that, we performed a systematic review about PLpro inhibitors from theperspective of in silico research, including possible therapeutic molecules inrelation to this viral protein. The neurological problems triggered by COVID-19were also briefly discussed, especially relative to the similarities ofneuroinflammation present in Alzheimer's disease. In this context, we focused on two molecules, curcumin and glycyrrhizinic acid, given their PLpro inhibitoryactions and neuroprotective properties and potential therapeutic effects onCOVID-19.

TI  - Epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment modalities of facial nerve palsyin COVID-19 patients: a systematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s13760-022-02026-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for a wide varietyof multi-system clinical features. Facial nerve palsy (FNP) is identified as one of the neurological complications of the virus. This work aims to systematically review the clinical picture, laboratory/imaging findings, treatment options, and prognostic factors of FNP in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Using six onlinedatabases, a search was conducted to include all articles with patients infected with COVID-19 and presenting with unilateral or bilateral FNP. Screening foreligibility and data extraction were done by three and four independentreviewers, respectively. Descriptive analyses and data visualizations were doneusing Google Sheets. Survival analysis and Kaplan-Meier plotting were done by Rsoftware. RESULTS: The data from 22 studies included 32 patients who wereinfected with COVID-19 and presented with clinical features of FNP. Fourteenpatients were male while 18 were female. FNP affected 29 patients unilaterallyand 3 patients bilaterally. The imaging findings confirmed that complications of FNP were COVID-19 related. Additionally, antivirals combined with steroids hadthe lowest median time (21, IQR = 8) to clinical improvement compared tosteroid-only (30, IQR = 15) and antiviral-only (33, IQR = 3.5) treatments.CONCLUSION: This study has shown a potential correlation between the increasedincidence of FNP and COVID-19. We have also found that combining antivirals with steroids may have better outcomes in patients with FNP and COVID-19 although the evidence to support this claim is not strong enough. Further studies are requiredto assess the extent of linkage between the two conditions and how to properlymanage FNP when encountered in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into the different protective mechanisms of approvedvaccines, this study focuses on the comparison of humoral and cellular immuneresponses of five widely used vaccines including ChAdOx1 (AZD1222, AstraZeneca), BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), and Gam-COVID-Vac(Sputnik V). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolated plasma from 95 volunteers' bloodsamples was used to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular immuneresponses. Positive controls were recovered patients from COVID-19(unvaccinated). Specific quantification kits for anti-nucleocapsid IgG,anti-Spike protein IgG, neutralizing antibodies as well as specific SARS-CoV-2antigens for T-cell activation were used and Spearman correlation and matrixanalyses were performed to compare overall immune responses. RESULTS:Nucleocapsid antibodies were significantly higher for the BBIBP-CorV andconvalescent group when compared to other vaccines. In contrast, subjectsvaccinated with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 presented significantly higher anti-spike IgG. In fact, 9.1% of convalescent, 4.5% of Gam-COVID-Vac, 28.6% of ChAdOx1, and 12.5% of BBIBP-CorV volunteers did not generate anti-spike IgG. Similarly, apositive correlation was observed after the neutralization assay. T-cellactivation studies showed that mRNA-based vaccines induced a T-cell driven immuneresponse in all cases, while 55% of convalescents, 8% of BNT162b1, 12,5% ofmRNA-1273, 9% of Gam-COVID-Vac, 57% of ChAdOx1, and 56% of BBIBP-CorV subjectspresented no cellular response. Further correlation matrix analyses indicatedthat anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies production, and T-cell activationfollow the same trend after immunization. CONCLUSIONS: RNA-based vaccines inducedthe most robust adaptive immune activation against SARS-CoV-2 by promoting asignificantly higher T-cell response, anti-spike IgG and neutralization levels.Vector-based vaccines protected against the virus at a comparable level toconvalescent patients.

LID - 10.26355/eurrev_202207_29319 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic broke out,caused by the coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reinfections can be observed with various respiratory viruses,including human coronaviruses. Moreover, they may result from weak or waninginitial immune response, reinfection with another genotype/subtype, or the rapid antigenic changes in the virus. The aim of this study was to investigate thelikelihood of reinfection in COVID-19 patients that had a positive qPCR testresult at least 60 days after a negative test result in patients that wereconfirmed with COVID-19 on qPCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results of a total of 105,000 samples that hadbeen obtained between April 1, 2020, and February 1, 2021, in two separateauthorized laboratories were retrospectively analyzed. 22 samples from 11patients included in the study, qPCR tests were repeated for each sample usingthe Rotorgene Q PCR system with Diagnovital SARS-CoV-2 (RTA Labs, Turkey)Real-Time PCR kits. Positive samples were screened for B.1.1.7 and E484Kmutations using the qPCR method on the Rotorgene Q PCR system with Bio-SpeedySARS-CoV-2 Variant Plus kits (Bioeksen Technology, Turkey). RESULTS: The 105,000 individuals comprised 55,614 men and 49,386 women. In the qPCR test, 14,511(13.82%) individuals were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 11(0.076%) patients were included in the study based on the inclusion criteria.Accordingly, the risk of reinfection was calculated as 0.076% (95% confidenceinterval [CI]: 0.056%-0.096%) and the incidence was 1.04 per 10,000 population(95% CI: 0.62-1.38 per 10,000). No patient was admitted to the intensive careunit or died during both episodes. Moreover, no B.1.1.7 or E484K mutation wasdetected in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of COVID-19 infectionposes serious risks for the development of new variants and the currently usedvaccines are likely to lose their efficacy against new variants. To reduce these risks and to be successful in the fight against the pandemic, we suggestcompliance with personal protective measures as well as rapid and widespreadapplication of vaccination not only in developed countries but also in the whole world and the modification of currently used vaccines in such a way to fightagainst newly emerged variants.

TI  - Study on aptamer based high throughput approach identifies natural ingredientsagainst RGNNV.
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13693 [doi]
AB  - Nervous necrosis virus (NNV) is one of the most destructive pathogens in marinefish aquaculture and is capable of infecting more than 50 fish species worldwide,which resulted in great economic losses. Effective drugs for managing NNVinfection are urgently required. Medicinal plants have been known for thousandsof years and benefit of medicinal plants against pathogens in aquaculture haveemerged. Nowadays, the most commonly used method for detecting virus infectionand assessing antiviral drugs efficacy is reverse transcription-quantitativereal-time PCR. However, the application is limited on account of high reagentcosts, complex time-consuming operations and long detection time. Aptamers havebeen widely applied in application of pathogens or diseases diagnosis andtreatments because of high specificity, strong affinity, good stability, easysynthesized and low costs. This study aimed to establish an aptamer (GBN34)-basedhigh-throughput screening (GBN34-AHTS) model for efficient selection andevaluation of natural ingredients against NNV infection. GBN34-AHTS is anexpeditious rapid method for selecting natural ingredients against NNV, which is characterized with high-speed, dram, sensitive and accurate. AHTS strategy could reduce work intensity and experimental costs and shorten the whole screeningcycle of effective ingredients. AHTS should be suitable for rapid selection ofeffective ingredients against other viruses, which is important for improving theprevention and controlling of aquatic diseases.

TI  - Effects of natural RNA modifications on the activity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
LID - 10.1111/febs.16587 [doi]
AB  - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays the key role in replication of RNAviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Processive RNA synthesis by RdRp is crucial forsuccessful genome replication and expression, especially in the case of very longcoronaviral genomes. Here, we analyzed the activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (thensp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex) on synthetic primer-templates of various structures,including substrates with mismatched primers or template RNA modifications. Ithas been shown that RdRp cannot efficiently extend RNA primers containingmismatches and has no intrinsic RNA cleavage activity to remove the primer3'-end, thus necessitating the action of exoribonuclease for proofreading.Similarly to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RdRp can perform processivepyrophosphorolysis of the nascent RNA product but this reaction is also blockedin the presence of mismatches. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that naturalpost-transcriptional modifications in the RNA template that do not preventcomplementary interactions (N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, inosine andpseudouridine) do not change RdRp processivity. At the same time, certainmodifications of RNA bases and ribose residues strongly block RNA synthesis,either prior to nucleotide incorporation (3-methyluridine, 1-methylguanosine) or immediately after it (2'-O-methylation). The results demonstrate that theactivity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can be strongly inhibited by common modifications of the RNA template suggesting a way for design of novel antiviral compounds.

TI  - Longitudinal monitoring of BKPyV miRNA levels in kidney transplant recipientswith BKPyV related pathology reflects viral DNA levels and remain high in viremiapatients after clearance of viral DNA.
LID - 10.1111/tid.13927 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether polyomavirus BK (BKPyV) miRNA measurement hasadditional diagnostic and predictive value in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) as compared to current methods of monitoring BKPyV DNA loads. PATIENTS ANDMETHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal study was performed in 30 KTR with BKPyVviruria (n = 10), BKPyV viremia (n = 10) or BKPyVAN (n = 10). Bkv-miR-B1-3p, 5pand BKPyV DNA-load were measured in urine and plasma and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Levels of Bkv-miR-B1-3p and 5pand BKPyV DNA correlated strongly. Overall, mostly analogue courses of urinaryand plasma miRNA and DNA loads were observed. Areas under the ROC curves were notsignificantly different between miRNAs and DNA. Only, in contrast to BKPyV DNAload, BKPyV miRNA levels increased from 6 to 12 months in the viremia group,while in the BKPyVAN group a decline was seen in both DNA and miRNA. CONCLUSIONS:In this study we could not demonstrate an additional value of BKPyV miRNAdetection compared to BKPyV DNA monitoring in the early phase after kidneytransplantation. We did observe significant differences between the viremia andthe BKPyVAN groups during follow up. This study was performed with a small numberof patients and therefore results should be verified in a larger patient cohort. Furthermore, future studies with larger patient groups are necessary to elucidatefinal clinical value of these data. This article is protected by copyright. Allrights reserved.

TI  - Identification of NS5B Resistance against SOFOSBUVIR in Hepatitis C VirusGenotype 3a, naive and treated Patients.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15754 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Pakistan has the second highest prevalence of HCV with genotype 3a (GT-3a) being the most frequently circulating genotype. Currently resistance associatedsubstitutions (RASs) are a major challenge in HCV treatment with direct actingantivirals (DAAs). Sofosbuvir (SOF) is an FDA-approved NS5B nucleotide inhibitor.The aim of this study was to identify these RASs in the NS5B gene in naive andtreated Pakistani HCV 3a isolates against SOF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood sampleswere collected from anti-HCV positive patients, followed by HCV RNA isolation andreal time PCR quantification. HCV positive patients were processed for HCV RNAgenotyping, Patients with genotype 3a were processed for NS5B gene amplification and sequencing. GT-3a was the most prevalent genotype (62.2%). S282T wasidentified in 2 (8.7%) patients, C316Y/G/R in 3 (13%), V321A, and L320P in 1(4.3%) each in SOF/RBV resistant patients. Variants of S282 were detected in 3(13%) of SOF/RBV treated patients. While INF/RBV associated mutations were alsoanalyzed, D244N, A333R, and A334E were identified in 2 (9.5%), 3 (14.2%), and 7(33.3%) in treatment-naive and 15 (65.2%), 7 (30.4%), and 5 (21.7%) treatedpatients respectively. Q309R was observed only in one treatment experiencedpatients. Some substitutions were present at higher frequency in both groups likeN307G, K304R, A272D and R345H, considered that they do not have any role inSofosbuvir resistance. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that Sofosbuvir RASs arepresent in Pakistani HCV GT-3a isolates, and they should be monitored carefully, especially in treatment-experienced patients, for further selection of treatment regimens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: HCV RASs have been studied very well across the world but there is scarcity of data regarding this topic in Pakistani population, this study provides data regarding prevalence of these RASs inPakistani HCV isolates emphasizing the fact that these RASs must be carefullymonitored before starting HCV treatment especially in treatment failure patients.

TI  - Porcine Deltacoronavirus Infection Cleaves HDAC2 to Attenuate Its AntiviralActivity.
PG  - e0102722
LID - 10.1128/jvi.01027-22 [doi]
AB  - Protein acetylation plays an important role during virus infection. Thus, it isnot surprising that viruses always evolve elaborate mechanisms to regulate thefunctions of histone deacetylases (HDACs), the essential transcriptional andepigenetic regulators for deacetylation. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), anemerging enteropathogenic coronavirus, causes severe diarrhea in suckling pigletsand has the potential to infect humans. In this study, we found that PDCoVinfection inhibited cellular HDAC activity. By screening the expressions ofdifferent HDAC subfamilies after PDCoV infection, we unexpectedly found thatHDAC2 was cleaved. Ectopic expression of HDAC2 significantly inhibited PDCoVreplication, while the reverse effects could be observed after treatment with an HDAC2 inhibitor (CAY10683) or the knockdown of HDAC2 expression by specificsiRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PDCoV-encoded nonstructural protein 5(nsp5), a 3C-like protease, was responsible for HDAC2 cleavage through itsprotease activity. Detailed analyses showed that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved HDAC2 atglutamine 261 (Q261), and the cleaved fragments (amino acids 1 to 261 and 262 to 488) lost the ability to inhibit PDCoV replication. Interestingly, the Q261cleavage site is highly conserved in HDAC2 homologs from other mammalian species,and the nsp5s encoded by seven tested mammalian coronaviruses also cleaved HDAC2,suggesting that cleaving HDAC2 may be a common strategy used by differentmammalian coronaviruses to antagonize the antiviral role of HDAC2. IMPORTANCE As an emerging porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus that possesses the potential to infect humans, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is receiving increasingattention. In this work, we found that PDCoV infection downregulated cellularhistone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Of particular interest, the viral 3C-likeprotease, encoded by the PDCoV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), cleaved HDAC2, andthis cleavage could be observed in the context of PDCoV infection. Furthermore,the cleavage of HDAC2 appears to be a common strategy among mammaliancoronaviruses, including the emerging severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to antagonize the antiviral role of HDAC2. To ourknowledge, PDCoV nsp5 is the first identified viral protein that can cleavecellular HDAC2. Results from our study provide new targets to develop drugscombating coronavirus infection.

TI  - Differential Recognition of Computationally Optimized H3 Hemagglutinin Influenza Vaccine Candidates by Human Antibodies.
PG  - e0089622
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00896-22 [doi]
AB  - Among circulating influenza viruses in humans, H3N2 viruses typically evolvefaster than other subtypes and have caused disease in millions of people sinceemerging in 1968. Computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA)technology is one strategy to broaden vaccine-elicited antibody responses amonginfluenza subtypes. In this study, we determined the structural integrity of anH3N2 COBRA hemagglutinin (HA), TJ5, and we probed the antigenic profile ofseveral H3N2 COBRA HAs by assessing recognition of these immunogens by human Bcells from seasonally vaccinated human subjects. Of three recently describedCOBRA H3 HA antigens (TJ5, NG2, and J4), we determined that TJ5 and J4 HAproteins recognize pre-existing B cells more effectively than NG2 HA and awild-type Hong Kong/4801/2014 protein. We also isolated a panel of 12 H3HA-specific human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and identified that most MAbsrecognize both wild-type and COBRA HA proteins and have functional activityagainst a broad panel of H3N2 viruses. Most MAbs target the receptor-bindingsite, and one MAb targets the HA stem. MAb TJ5-5 recognizes TJ5 and J4 COBRA HAproteins but has poor recognition of NG2 HA, similar to the global B-cellanalysis. We determined a 3.4 A structure via cryo-electron microscopy of FabTJ5-5 complexed with the H3 COBRA TJ5, which revealed residues important to thedifferential binding. Overall, these studies determined that COBRA H3 HA proteinshave correct antigenic and structural features, and the proteins are recognizedby B cells and MAbs isolated from seasonally vaccinated humans. IMPORTANCEVaccine development for circulating influenza viruses, particularly for the H3N2 subtype, remains challenging due to consistent antigenic drift. Computationallyoptimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) technology has proven effective forbroadening influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-elicited antibody responses compared towild-type immunogens. Here, we determined the structural features and antigenicprofiles of H3 COBRA HA proteins. Two H3 COBRA HA proteins, TJ5 and J4, arebetter recognized by pre-existing B cells and monoclonal antibodies from the 2017to 2018 vaccine season compared to COBRA NG2 and a wild-type A/Hong Kong/2014 HA protein. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of one MAb that poorly recognizes NG2, MAb TJ5-5, in complex with the TJ5 COBRA HA proteinand identified residues critical to MAb recognition. As NG2 is more effectivethan TJ5 for the recent Hong Kong/2019 virus, these data provide insights intothe diminished effectiveness of influenza vaccines across vaccine seasons.

AB  - Co-infection with hepatitis B (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)increases overall and liver-related mortality. In order to identify interactions between these two viruses in vivo, full-length HIV proviruses were sequenced froma cohort of HIV-HBV co-infected participants and from a cohort of HIVmono-infected participants recruited from Bangkok, Thailand, both before theinitiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and after at least 2 years of ART. Theco-infected individuals were found to have higher levels of genetically-intactHIV proviruses than did mono-infected individuals pre-therapy. In theseco-infected individuals, higher levels of genetically-intact HIV proviruses orproviral genetic-diversity were also associated with higher levels of sCD14 andCXCL10, suggesting that immune activation is linked to more genetically-intactHIV proviruses. Three years of ART decreased the overall level of HIV proviruses,with fewer genetically-intact proviruses being identified in co-infected versusmono-infected individuals. However, ART increased the frequency of certaingenetic defects within proviruses and the expansion of identical HIV sequences.IMPORTANCE With the increased availability and efficacy of ART, co-morbiditiesare now one of the leading causes of death in HIV-positive individuals. One ofthese co-morbidities is co-infection with HBV. However, co-infections are stillrelatively understudied, especially in countries where such co-infections areendemic. Furthermore, these countries have different subtypes of HIV circulating than the commonly studied HIV subtype B. We believe that our study serves thisunderstudied niche and provides a novel approach to investigating the impact ofHBV co-infection on HIV infection. We examine co-infection at the molecular levelin order to investigate indirect associations between the two viruses throughtheir interactions with the immune system. We demonstrate that increased immuneinflammation and activation in HBV co-infected individuals is associated withhigher HIV viremia and an increased number of genetically-intact HIV provirusesin peripheral blood cells. This leads us to hypothesize that inflammation couldbe a driver in the increased mortality rate of HIV-HBV co-infected individuals.

AB  - Prior studies have demonstrated prolonged presence of yellow fever virus (YFV)RNA in saliva and urine as an alternative to serum. To investigate the presenceof YFV RNA in urine, we used RT-PCR for YFV screening in 60 urine samplescollected from a large cohort of naturally infected yellow fever (YF) patientsduring acute and convalescent phases of YF infection from recent YF outbreaks in Brazil (2017 to 2018). Fifteen urine samples from acute phase infection (up to 15days post-symptom onset) and four urine samples from convalescent phase infection(up to 69 days post-symptom onset), were YFV PCR-positive. We genotyped YFVdetected in seven urine samples (five collected during the acute phase and twocollected during the YF convalescent phase). Genotyping indicated the presence ofYFV South American I genotype in these samples. To our knowledge, this is thefirst report of wild-type YFV RNA detection in the urine this far out fromsymptom onset (up to 69 DPS), including YFV RNA detection during the convalescentphase of YF infection. The detection of YFV RNA in urine is an indicative of YFV infection; however, the results of RT-PCR using urine as sample should beinterpreted with care, since a negative result does not exclude the possibilityof YFV infection. With a possible prolonged period of detection beyond theviremic phase, the use of urine samples coupled with serological tests,epidemiologic inquiry, and clinical assessment could provide a longer diagnostic window for laboratory YF diagnosis.

TI  - Induction of Interferon-Stimulated Genes Correlates with Reduced Growth ofInfluenza A Virus in Lungs after RIG-I Agonist Treatment of Ferrets.
PG  - e0055922
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00559-22 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular RIG-I receptors represent key innate sensors of RNA virusinfection, and RIG-I activation results in the induction of hundreds of hosteffector genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Synthetic RNAagonists targeting RIG-I have shown promise as antivirals against a broadspectrum of viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), in both in vitro andmouse models of infection. Herein, we demonstrate that treatment of a ferretairway epithelial (FRL) cell line with a RIG-I agonist rapidly and potentlyinduced expression of a broad range of ISGs and resulted in potent inhibition of growth of different IAV strains. In ferrets, a single intravenous injection ofRIG-I agonist was associated with upregulated ISG expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lung tissue, but not in nasal tissues. In a ferret model ofviral contact transmission, a single treatment of recipient animals 24 h prior tocohousing with IAV-infected donors did not reduce virus transmission and sheddingbut did result in reduced lung virus titers 6 days after treatment. A singletreatment of the IAV-infected donor animals also resulted in reduced virus titersin the lungs 2 days later. Thus, a single intravenous treatment with RIG-Iagonist prior to infection or to ferrets with an established IAV infection canreduce virus growth in the lungs. These findings support further development ofRIG-I agonists as effective antiviral treatments to limit the impact of IAVinfections, particularly in reducing virus replication in the lower airways.IMPORTANCE RIG-I agonists have shown potential as broad-spectrum antivirals invitro and in mouse models of infection. However, their antiviral potential hasnot been reported in outbred animals such as ferrets, which are widely regardedas the gold standard small animal model for human IAV infections. Herein, wedemonstrate that RIG-I agonist treatment of a ferret airway cell line resulted inISG induction and inhibition of a broad range of human influenza viruses. Asingle intravenous treatment of ferrets also resulted in systemic induction ofISGs, including in lung tissue, and when delivered to animals prior to IAVexposure or to animals with established IAV infection treatment resulted inreduced virus replication in the lungs. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of single RIG-I treatment against IAV in the ferret model and highlight theimportance of future studies to optimize treatment regimens and delivery routesto maximize their ability to ameliorate IAV infections.

TI  - Immune Escape Adaptive Mutations in Hemagglutinin Are Responsible for theAntigenic Drift of Eurasian Avian-Like H1N1 Swine Influenza Viruses.
PG  - e0097122
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00971-22 [doi]
AB  - The continuous antigenic variation of influenza A viruses remains a major hurdle for vaccine selection; however, the molecular determinants and mechanisms ofantigenic change remain largely unknown. In this study, two escape mutants weregenerated by serial passages of the Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine influenzavirus (EA H1N1 SIV) A/swine/Henan/11/2005 (HeN11) in the presence of twoneutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the hemagglutinin (HA) protein,which were designated HeN11-2B6-P5 and HeN11-4C7-P8, respectively. TheHeN11-2B6-P5 mutant simultaneously harbored the N190D and I230M substitutions in HA, whereas HeN11-4C7-P8 harbored the M269R substitution in HA (H3 numbering).The effects of each of these substitutions on viral antigenicity were determined by measuring the neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers with mAbs and polyclonal sera raised against the representative viruses. The resultsindicate that residues 190 and 269 are key determinants of viral antigenicvariation. In particular, the N190D mutation had the greatest antigenic impact,as determined by the HI assay. Further studies showed that both HeN11-2B6-P5 and HeN11-4C7-P8 maintained the receptor-binding specificity of the parent virus,although the single mutation N190D decreased the binding affinity for thehuman-type receptor. The replicative ability in vitro of HeN11-2B6-P5 wasincreased, whereas that of HeN11-4C7-P8 was decreased. These findings extend our understanding of the antigenic evolution of influenza viruses under immunepressure and provide insights into the functional effects of amino acidsubstitutions near the receptor-binding site and the interplay among receptorbinding, viral replication, and antigenic drift. IMPORTANCE The antigenic changesthat occur continually in the evolution of influenza A viruses remain a greatchallenge for the effective control of disease outbreaks. Here, we identifiedthree amino acid substitutions (at positions 190, 230, and 269) in the HA of EAH1N1 SIVs that determine viral antigenicity and result in escape fromneutralizing monoclonal antibodies. All three of these substitutions have emergedin nature. Of note, residues 190 and 230 have synergistic effects on receptorbinding and antigenicity. Our findings provide a better understanding of thefunctional effects of amino acid substitutions in HA and their consequences forthe antigenic drift of influenza viruses.

PG  - e0077522
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00775-22 [doi]
AB  - Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)variants, especially the Omicron variant, have impaired the efficacy of existing vaccines and most therapeutic antibodies, highlighting the need for additionalantibody-based tools that can efficiently neutralize emerging SARS-CoV-2variants. The use of a "single" agent to simultaneously target multiple distinct epitopes on the spike is desirable in overcoming the neutralizing escape ofSARS-CoV-2 variants. Herein, we generated a human-derived IgG-like bispecificantibody (bsAb), Bi-Nab35B5-47D10, which successfully retained parentalspecificity and simultaneously bound to the two distinct epitopes onreceptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2. Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 showed improved spikebinding breadth among wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2, variants of concern (VOCs), and variants being monitored (VBMs) compared with its parental monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Furthermore, pseudotyped virus neutralization demonstrated thatBi-Nab35B5-47D10 can efficiently neutralize VBMs, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta(B.1.351), and Kappa (B.1.617.1), as well as VOCs, including Delta (B.1.617.2),Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2. Crucially, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 substantiallyimproved neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1 (IC50 = 0.15 nM) and Omicron BA.2 (IC50 = 0.67 nM) compared with its parental MAbs. Therefore,Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 represents a potential effective countermeasure againstSARS-CoV-2 Omicron and other variants of concern. IMPORTANCE The new, highlycontagious SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant caused substantial breakthrough infections and has become the dominant strain in countries across the world. Omicronvariants usually bear high mutations in the spike protein and exhibitconsiderable escape of most potent neutralization monoclonal antibodies andreduced efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines. The development of neutralizingantibodies with potent efficacy against the Omicron variant is still an urgentpriority. Here, we generated a bsAb, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10, which simultaneouslytargets SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S2 and improves the neutralizing potency and breadthagainst SARS-CoV-2 WT and the tested variants compared with their parentalantibodies. Notably, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 has more potent neutralizing activityagainst the VOC Omicron pseudotyped virus. Therefore, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 is afeasible and potentially effective strategy by which to treat and preventCOVID-19.

TI  - Minding the Matrix: The Importance of Inoculum Suspensions on Finger TransferEfficiency of Virus.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15758 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine how transfer efficiency of MS-2coliphage from toilet seat to hands and fingertip to lip differs according to thesuspension of the inoculum. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hands were sampled after liftinga toilet seat which was inoculated with MS-2 on the underneath side. MS-2 wassuspended in a spectrum of proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous solutions.Transfer efficiencies were greatest with the ASTM tripartite soil load (3.02% +/-4.03) and lowest with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (1.10% +/- 0.81) forhand-to-toilet seat contacts. Finger-to-lip transfer rates were significantlydifferent (p < 0.05) depending on suspension matrix, with PBS yielding thehighest transfer (52.53% +/- 4.48%) and tryptose soy broth (TSB) the lowest(23.15% +/- 24.27%). Quantitative microbial risk assessment was used to estimate probability of infection from adenovirus and norovirus from finger contact with atoilet seat. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest transfer as well as the largest variation of transfer were measured for finger-to-lip contacts as opposed to toiletseat-to-finger contacts. These factors influence the estimation of probability ofinfection from micro-activity i.e., toilet seat adjustment. SIGNIFICANCE ANDIMPACT: Viruses may be transferred from various human excreta with differingtransfer efficiencies, depending on the protein content.

LID - 10.5935/1518-0557.20220019 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has emerged as the biggest pandemic of the world of all times. Its deathtoll is rising globally. COVID-19 mostly affects the lungs because the virusenters the host cells via the receptor for the ACE2 enzyme, which is also presentin other organs of the human body. ACE2 plays the main role in the degradation ofAng II, resulting in the formation of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) which maintainsthe level of Ang II. This communication gives an assessment of reproductivesystem functioning and its effects by the COVID-19 exposure. It is important tomaintain the wellbeing for healthy nourishment of the fetus and safe deliveryalong with post health issues. ACE2 enzyme metabolism is expressed in the female reproductive system, and it may be potential target of COVID-19 exposure.

AB  - Phlebotomus chinensis sandfly is a neglected insect vector in China which iswell-known for carrying Leishmania. Recent studies have expanded its pathogenrepertoire with two novel arthropod-borne phleboviruses capable of infectinghuman and animals. Despite these discoveries, our knowledge on the generalpathogen diversity and overall microbiome composition of this vector species are still very limited. Here we carried out a meta-transcriptomics analysis whichsimultaneously revealed the actively replicating/transcribing RNA viruses, DNAviruses, bacteria and eukaryotic microbes, namely, "total microbiome", of severalsandfly populations in China. Strikingly, "microbiome" made up 1.8% of totalnon-ribosomal RNA and were comprised of more than 87 species, among which 70 werenovel, including divergent members of the genera Flavivirus and of the familyTrypanosomatidae. Importantly, among these microbes we were able to reveal fourdistinguished types of human and/or mammalian pathogens, including twophleboviruses (hedi and wuxiang viruses), one novel Spotted fever grouprickettsia, as well as a member of Leishmania donovani complex, among which hedi virus and Leishmania each had > 50% pool prevalence rate and relatively highabundance levels. Our study also showed the ubiquitous presence of anendosymbiont, namely Wolbachia, although no anti-viral or anti-pathogen effectwere detected based on our data. In summary, our results uncovered the muchun-explored diversity of microbes harbored by sandflies in China and demonstratedthat high pathogen diversity and abundance is currently present in multiplepopulations, implying disease potential for exposed local human population ordomestic animals.

TI  - Virome of Giant Panda-Infesting Ticks Reveals Novel Bunyaviruses and OtherViruses That Are Genetically Close to Those from Giant Pandas.
PG  - e0203422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02034-22 [doi]
AB  - Tick infestations have been reported as one of the factors threatening the healthof giant pandas, but studies of viral pathogens carried by ticks feeding on theblood of giant pandas are limited. To assess whether blood-sucking ticks of giantpandas can carry viral pathogens and if so, whether the viruses in ticks areassociated with those previously detected in giant panda hosts, we determined theviromes of ticks detached from giant pandas in a field stocking area in SichuanProvince, southwest China. Using viral metagenomics we identified 32 viralspecies in ticks, half of which (including anellovirus [n = 9], circovirus [n =3], and gemycircularvirus [n = 4]) showed homology to viruses carried by giantpandas and their associated host species (such as red pandas and mosquitoes) inthe same living domain. Remarkably, several viruses in this studyphylogenetically assigned as bunyavirus, hepe-like virus, and circovirus weredetected with relatively high abundance, but whether these newly identifiedtick-associated viruses can replicate in ticks and then transmit to host animals during a blood meal will require further investigation. These findings furtherexpand our understanding of the role of giant panda-infesting ticks in the local ecosystem, especially related to viral acquisition and transmission, and lay afoundation to assess the risk for giant panda exposure to tick-borne viruses.IMPORTANCE Ticks rank only second to mosquitoes as blood-feeding arthropods,capable of spreading pathogens (including viruses, bacteria, and parasites) tohosts during a blood meal. To better understand the relationship between viruses carried by ticks and viruses that have been reported in giant pandas, it isnecessary to analyze the viromes of giant panda-parasitic blood-sucking ticks.This study collected 421 ticks on the body surface of giant pandas in SichuanProvince, China. We characterized the extensive genetic diversity of virusesharbored by these ticks and reported frequent communication of viruses betweengiant pandas and their ticks. While most of the virome discovered here arenonpathogenic viruses from giant pandas and potentially tick-specific viruses, werevealed some possible tick-borne viruses, represented by novel bunyaviruses.This research contributes to the literature because currently there are fewstudies on the virome of giant panda-infesting ticks.

TI  - A Variant Allele in Varicella-Zoster Virus Glycoprotein B Selected duringProduction of the Varicella Vaccine Contributes to Its Attenuation.
PG  - e0186422
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01864-22 [doi]
AB  - Attenuation of the live varicella Oka vaccine (vOka) has been attributed tomutations in the genome acquired during cell culture passage of pOka (parentstrain); however, the precise mechanisms of attenuation remain unknown.Comparative sequence analyses of several vaccine batches showed that over 100single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are conserved across all vaccine batches; 6 SNPs are nearly fixed, suggesting that these SNPs are responsible forattenuation. By contrast, prior analysis of chimeric vOka and pOka recombinantsindicates that loci other than these six SNPs contribute to attenuation. Here, wereport that pOka consists of a heterogenous population of virus sequences withtwo nearly equally represented bases, guanine (G) or adenine (A), at nucleotide2096 of the ORF31 coding sequence, which encodes glycoprotein B (gB) resulting inarginine (R) or glutamine (Q), respectively, at amino acid 699 of gB. Bycontrast, 2096A/699Q is dominant in vOka (>99.98%). gB699Q/gH/gL showedsignificantly less fusion activity than gB699R/gH/gL in a cell-based fusionassay. Recombinant pOka with gB669Q (rpOka_gB699Q) had a similar growth phenotypeas vOka during lytic infection in cell culture including human primary skincells; however, rpOka_gB699R showed a growth phenotype similar to pOka.rpOka_gB699R entered neurons from axonal terminals more efficiently thanrpOka_gB699Q in the presence of cell membrane-derived vesicles containing gB.Strikingly, when a mixture of pOka with both alleles equally represented was usedto infect human neurons from axon terminals, pOka with gB699R was dominant forvirus entry. These results identify a variant allele in gB that contributes toattenuation of vOka. IMPORTANCE The live-attenuated varicella vaccine has reducedthe burden of chickenpox. Despite its development in 1974, the molecular basisfor its attenuation is still not well understood. Since the live-attenuatedvaricella vaccine is the only licensed human herpesvirus vaccine that preventsprimary disease, it is important to understand the mechanism for its attenuation.Here we identify that a variant allele in glycoprotein B (gB) selected duringgeneration of the varicella vaccine contributes to its attenuation. This variant is impaired for fusion, virus entry into neurons from nerve terminals, andreplication in human skin cells. Identification of a variant allele in gB, one ofthe essential herpesvirus core genes, that contributes to its attenuation mayprovide insights that assist in the development of other herpesvirus vaccines.

TI  - Genomic epidemiology of the first two waves of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada.

LID - e73896 [pii]
AB  - Tracking the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages using phylogenetics has proven critical to inform the timing and stringency of COVID-19 public healthinterventions. We investigated the effectiveness of international travelrestrictions at reducing SARS-CoV-2 importations and transmission in Canada inthe first two waves of 2020 and early 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic treeswere used to infer viruses' geographic origins, enabling identification of 2263(95% confidence interval: 2159-2366) introductions, including 680 (658-703)Canadian sublineages, which are international introductions resulting in sampled Canadian descendants, and 1582 (1501-1663) singletons, introductions with nosampled descendants. Of the sublineages seeded during the first wave, 49%(46-52%) originated from the USA and were primarily introduced into Quebec (39%) and Ontario (36%), while in the second wave, the USA was still the predominantsource (43%), alongside a larger contribution from India (16%) and the UK (7%).Following implementation of restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals on 21 March 2020, importations declined from 58.5 (50.4-66.5) sublineages per week to10.3-fold (8.3-15.0) lower within 4 weeks. Despite the drastic reduction in viralimportations following travel restrictions, newly seeded sublineages in summerand fall 2020 contributed to the persistence of COVID-19 cases in the secondwave, highlighting the importance of sustained interventions to reducetransmission. Importations rebounded further in November, bringing newly emergentvariants of concern (VOCs). By the end of February 2021, there had been anestimated 30 (19-41) B.1.1.7 sublineages imported into Canada, which increasinglydisplaced previously circulating sublineages by the end of the secondwave.Although viral importations are nearly inevitable when global prevalence is high, with fewer importations there are fewer opportunities for novel variants tospark outbreaks or outcompete previously circulating lineages.

LID - 10.1093/aje/kwac139 [doi]
AB  - We aimed to determine if long-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrationsare associated with increased risk of testing positive for COVID-19 amongpregnant individuals who were universally screened at delivery and ifsocioeconomic status (SES) modifies this relationship. We used obstetric datafrom Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City fromMarch-December 2020, which included Medicaid use (low-SES surrogate) andcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test results. We linked 300m resolutionestimated 2018-2019 PM2.5 concentrations and census tract-level populationdensity, household size and income, and mobility estimates. Analyses included3318 individuals; 5% tested positive for COVID-19 at delivery, 8% tested positiveduring pregnancy, 48% used Medicaid, and average long-term PM2.5 concentrationswere 7.4 mug/m3 (SD = 0.8). In adjusted multilevel logistic regression models, wesaw no association between PM2.5 and ever-testing positive for COVID-19; however,odds were elevated among those using Medicaid (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0, 2.5 per 1-mug/m3 increase). Further, while only 22% of those testing positive showed symptoms, 69% of symptomatic individuals used Medicaid. SES, including unmeasuredoccupational exposures or increased susceptibility to the virus due to co-social and environmental exposures, may explain the increased odds of testing positivefor COVID-19 confined to vulnerable pregnant individuals using Medicaid.

TI  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in coronavirus disease 2019 patients.
PG  - 443-449
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000859 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) has significantmorbidity and UGIB cases have been described in coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) patients. Management of this condition can be challenging considering both the possible severe COVID-19-related pneumonia as well as the risk of thevirus spreading from patients to health operators. The aim of this paper is toreview the most recent studies available in the literature in order to evaluatethe actual incidence of UGIB, its clinical and endoscopic manifestations and its optimal management. RECENT FINDINGS: UGIB has an incidence between 0.5% and 1.9% among COVID-19 patients, and it typically presents with melena or hematemesis.Peptic ulcers are the most common endoscopic findings. High Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), dialysis, acute kidney injury and advanced oncological diseaseincrease the risk for UGIB. Although anticoagulants are commonly used in COVID-19patients they are not associated with an increased incidence of UGIB.Conservative management is a common approach that results in similar outcomescompared to upper GI endoscopic treatment. Apparently, UGIB in COVID-19 seems nothave a detrimental effect and only one study showed an increased mortality inthose who developed UGIB during hospitalization. SUMMARY: Incidence of UGIB inCOVID-19 patients is similar to that of the general population. Despite thewidespread use of anticoagulants in these patients, they are not associated with an increased risk of UGIB. Conservative management could be an effective option, especially for patients that are at risk of intubation.

TI  - Diagnosis of COVID-19 associated arthritis in patients with or without underlyingrheumatic and musculoskeletal disease supported by musculoskeletal ultrasound: a case series from three European centres.
LID - 10.55563/clinexprheumatol/an1yrh [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic concerns the field of rheumatology in many ways. Arthritis in conjunction with COVID-19 is increasinglyreported. However, clinical data are still limited and there is lack of adetailed characterisation of COVID-19 associated arthritis by musculoskeletalultrasound (MSUS). This case series reports different forms of COVID-19associated arthritis supported by MSUS in patients with or without underlyingrheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD). METHODS: From March 2020 to July2021, adult patients (n=10) with arthritis timely related to COVID-19 wereassessed in three European centres by clinical and laboratory values andadditionally MSUS. RESULTS: In the group without underlying RMD (n=6), twopatients presented with polyarticular arthralgia during severe COVID-19, swellingwas rarely seen and MSUS demonstrated arthritis only in a few joints affected.The other four patients showed arthritis four to 16 weeks after mild or moderate COVID-19 (without hospitalisation): polyarthritis (n=1), oligoarthritis of theupper and lower limb (n=2), and in one case, late-onset rheumatoid arthritis(LORA) was newly diagnosed. In the group with an underlying RMD (n=4), anincrease of disease activity was reported by MSUS during mild and mild-moderateCOVID-19. In general, MSUS often presented power Doppler (PD) positive synovitis and tenosynovitis. CONCLUSIONS: In our patients without underlying RMD,arthritides associated with COVID-19 are comparable to the clinical picture of a reactive arthritis (ReA) or other virus-related arthritides (e.g. parvovirusB19). New onset or flares of RMD possibly triggered by COVID-19 are noteworthy.

TI  - Better together: the use of virus-induced gene silencing technique to repress theexpression of two endogenous citrus genes simultaneously.
PG  - 2106079
LID - 10.1080/15592324.2022.2106079 [doi]
AB  - Virus-induced gene silencing is a promising technique for functional genomicsstudies. Citrus tristeza virus was employed successfully to create an infectious clone that was used to silence endogenous citrus genes. Phytoene desaturase (PDS)and delta (delta)-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) were targetedsuccessfully in citrus. Silencing PDS usually results in a photo-bleached leafphenotype while silencing ALAD causes discrete yellow spots in leaves. Silencing two or more genes simultaneously using the same infectious clone could bedifficult due to the capacity of the plasmid and subsequent cloning. On the otherhand, inoculating a new construct into a citrus plant pre-infected with anotherconstruct fails due to the superinfection exclusion phenomenon. Herein, I report our successful trials whereby we simultaneously graft-inoculate constructstargeting PDS and ALAD. The budwoods were graft-inoculated into the same tree buton two different branches. Interestingly, a new phenotype was produced because ofthe silencing of the two genes, which we called "color-breaking". The phenotypewas observed in both branches. Gene expression analysis showed a significantreduction of PDS and ALAD transcripts. This finding suggests the possibility oftargeting more than one gene using different constructs, however, thegraft-inoculation must be at the same time.

TI  - A circular RNA vector for targeted plant gene silencing based on an asymptomatic viroid.
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15929 [doi]
AB  - Gene silencing for functional studies in plants has been largely facilitated bymanipulating viral genomes with inserts from host genes to trigger virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) against the corresponding mRNAs. However, viral genomesencode multiple proteins and can disrupt plant homeostasis by interfering withendogenous cell mechanisms. To try to circumvent this functional limitation, wehave developed a silencing method based on the minimal autonomously-infectiousnucleic acids currently known: viroids, which lack proven coding capability. The genome of Eggplant latent viroid, an asymptomatic viroid, was manipulated withinsertions ranging between 21 to 42 nucleotides. Our results show that, although larger insertions might be tolerated, the maintenance of the secondary structure appears to be critical for viroid genome stability. Remarkably, these modifiedELVd molecules are able to induce systemic infection promoting the silencing oftarget genes in eggplant. Inspired by the design of artificial microRNAs, we havedeveloped a simple and standardized procedure to generate stable insertions into the ELVd genome capable of silencing a specific target gene. Analogously to VIGS,we have termed our approach Viroid Induced Gene Silencing (VdIGS) and demonstratethat is a promising tool for dissecting gene functions in eggplant.

AB  - Modern small-angle scattering (SAS) experiments with neutrons (SANS) or X-rays(SAXS) combined with contrast variation provide comprehensive information aboutthe structure of large multicomponent macromolecules in solution and allow thesize, shape and relative arrangement of each component to be mapped out. Toobtain such information, it is essential to perform well designed experiments, inwhich all necessary steps, from assessing sample suitability to structuremodeling, are properly executed. This paper describes alpha-SAS, an integrativeapproach that is useful for effectively planning a biological contrast-variation SAS experiment. The accurate generation of expected experimental intensitiesusing alpha-SAS allows the substantial acceleratation of research into thestructure and function of biomacromolecules by minimizing the time and costsassociated with performing a SAS experiment. The method is validated using a few basic structures with known analytical expressions for scattering intensity andusing experimental SAXS data from Arabidopsis beta-amylase 1 protein and SANSdata from the histidine kinase-Sda complex and from human dystrophin without and with a membrane-mimicking nanodisk. Simulation of a SANS contrast-variationexperiment is performed for synthetic nanobodies that effectively neutralizeSARS-CoV-2.

TI  - When 3D genome technology meets viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28040 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian chromosomes undergo varying degrees of compression to formthree-dimensional genome structures. These three-dimensional structures undergodynamic and precise chromatin interactions to achieve precise spatial andtemporal regulation of gene expression. Most eukaryotic DNA viruses can invadetheir genomes into the nucleus. However, it is still poorly understood how theviral genome is precisely positioned after entering the host cell nucleus to findthe most suitable location and whether it can specifically interact with the hostgenome to hijack the host transcriptional factories or even integrate into thehost genome to complete its transcription and replication rapidly. Chromosomeconformation capture technology can reveal long-range chromatin interactionsbetween different chromosomal sites in the nucleus, potentially providing areference for viral DNA-host chromatin interactions. This review summarized theresearch progress on the three-dimensional interaction between virus and hostgenome and the impact of virus integration into the host genome on genetranscription regulation, aiming to provide new insights into chromatininteraction and viral gene transcription regulation, laying the foundation forthe treatment of infectious diseases.

TI  - Reconstruction and validation of entire virus model with complete genome frommixed resolution cryo-EM density.
LID - 10.1039/d2fd00053a [doi]
AB  - It is very difficult to reconstruct computationally a large biomolecular complex in its biological entirety from experimental data. The resulting atomistic model should not contain gaps structurally and it should yield stable dynamics. We, forthe first time, reconstruct from the published incomplete cryo-EM density acomplete MS2 virus at atomistic resolution, that is, the capsid with the genome, and validate the result by all-atom molecular dynamics with explicit water. Theavailable experimental data includes a high resolution protein capsid and aninhomogeneously resolved genome map. For the genomic RNA, apart from 16 hairpins with atomistic resolution, the strands near the capsid's inner surface wereresolved up to the nucleic backbone level, and the innermost density wascompletely unresolved. As a result, only 242 nucleotides (out of 3569) werepositioned, while only a fragmented backbone was outlined for the rest of thegenome, making a detailed model reconstruction necessary. For modelreconstruction, in addition to the available atomistic structure information, we extensively used the predicted secondary structure of the genome (base pairing). The technique was based on semi-automatic building of relatively large strands ofRNA with subsequent manual positioning over the traced backbone. The entire virusstructure (capsid + genome) was validated by a molecular dynamics run inphysiological solution with ions at standard conditions confirming the stability of the model.

AB  - Norovirus (NoV) belongs to the Calciviridae family that causes diarrhoea,vomiting, and stomach pain in people who have acute gastroenteritis (AGE).Identifying multi-epitope dependent vaccines for single stranded positive senseviruses such as NoV has been a long due. Although efforts have been in place tolook into the candidate epitopes, understanding molecular mimicry and finding newepitopes for inducing immune responses against the T/B-cells which play animportant role for the cell-mediated and humoral immunity was not dealt with ingreat detail. The current study focuses on identifying new epitopes from various databases that were filtered for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Theadjuvant beta-defensin along with different linkers were used for vaccineconstruction. Further, the binding relationship between the vaccine construct andtoll-like immune receptor (TLR3) complex was determined using a molecular dockinganalysis, followed by molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns. The vaccinecandidate developed expresses good solubility with a score of 0.530, Z-score of-4.39 and molecular docking score of -140.4 +/- 12.1. The MD trajectories reveal that there is a stability between TLR3 and the developed vaccine candidate withan average of 0.91 nm RMSD value and also the system highest occupancy H-bondformed between GLU127 of TLR3 and TYR10 of vaccine candidate (61.55%). Four more H-bonds exist with an occupancy of more than 32% between TLR3 and the vaccinecandidates which makes it stable. Thus, the multi-epitope based vaccine developedin the present study forms the basis for further experimental investigations todevelop a potentially good vaccine against NoV.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.Sarma.

AB  - Cough is a frequent reason for consultation in the general practitioner's office.Most of the time, the symptom is harmless and self-limiting, as in the case of a banal cold cough, for example - however, serious diseases such as malignanciescan also be the cause. Evaluation is therefore not always easy. This articlepresents a targeted and appropriate approach and discusses which treatments arerecommended and effective.Acute and chronic cough are differentiated according tothe duration of symptoms (up to 8 weeks/longer than 8 weeks). The most commoncause of acute cough is a self-limiting viral infection of the upper respiratory tract; the most important differential diagnosis is community-acquired pneumonia.If there are no defined warning signs (red flags), the history and clinicalexamination are sufficient to establish the diagnosis in the case of an acutecough; medication is not necessary. In the case of a chronic cough, a chest X-rayis usually ordered and then further investigations are carried out in accordance with the most probable suspected diagnosis; probationary therapies are animportant part of the workup. Coughs that are refractory to treatment orunexplained require individualised treatment (pharmacological, includingoff-label, non-pharmacological) and regular re-evaluation.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease with SARS-CoV-2 viral infection (COVID-19) and itsdiverse courses of disease from mild to critical illness frequently is not onlyan acute disease, but will - in a proportion of those affected - lead to organstructure and body function deficits that still exist or become apparent afterthe acute stage of disease. When clinically relevant symptoms or functionaldeficits (impairments) are documented more than four weeks after COVID-19 onset, the syndrome is called "Long-COVID", from 12 weeks after onset onwards"Post-COVID".In such cases and when everyday life functioning or return to workare affected by persisting deficits specialized rehabilitation treatment isindicated. An individual medical, frequently multi-professional diagnosticevaluation is mandatory in that situation: For adequate treatment, it isimportant to identify and objectify the individually underlying health conditionsbased on knowledge about the diverse potential consequences of COVID-19, toassess type and severity of functional consequences (impairments, activitylimitations, and restrictions of participation) of Long-/Post-COVID individually,and then to decide on the treatment necessities and plans. With regard torehabilitation, need and decision for either pulmonary, neurological, cardiac, orpsychosomatic rehabilitation depends on the individual medical presentation.

LID - 10.1002/hed.27083 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parotid lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) is a rare malignant tumor.The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological features of parotid LEC. METHODS: All patients clinicopathological information diagnosedparotid LEC from 2005 to 2017 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 146 cases ofparotid LECs were identified. Of these, 126 (86.3%) were primary and 20 (13.7%)were secondary LECs. Patients with secondary LEC tended to have tumors withearlier TNM staging than those with primary (p = 0.031). The tumor cells in 87(94.6%, 87/92) cases tested positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Cervical node metastases were present at diagnosis in 46 (31.5%) cases. Overall survival at 5and 10 years was 97.0% and 90.8%, respectively. Older age was an adverseprognostic indicator for overall survival (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Parotid LECis associated with EBV and an increased rate of cervical node metastases.However, most patients, especially younger ones, have a good prognosis.

PG  - 3066456
LID - 10.1155/2022/3066456 [doi]
AB  - X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a transcription factor that recognizes theCRE-like element in enhancers of human T-cell leukemia virus and MHC class IIgene and induces their transcription. This study was performed to characterizethe function of XBP1, which was identified to be a differentially expressed gene via GEO database, in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). XBP1 expression was significantly elevated in both CRSsNP patients and mice whowere accompanied with mucosal thickening, goblet cell hyperplasia and chemosis,glandular hyperplasia, and dense infiltration of inflammatory cells. Silencing ofXBP1 suppressed the development of CRSsNP in mice. Mechanistically, knockdown of XBP1 downregulated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a),and overexpression of XBP1 led to the opposite result. Silencing of HIF-1ainhibited beta-catenin expression and impaired the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.Further overexpression of HIF-1a in XBP1-silenced CRSsNP mice exacerbatedpathological changes in mouse nasal mucosal tissues, promoted inflammation, andactivated the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Taken together, overexpression of XBP1may be associated with increased expression of HIF-1a and possibly contribute to the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation and the development of CRSsNP.

TI  - Investigation of COVID-19 Misinformation in Arabic on Twitter: Content Analysis.
PG  - e37007
LID - 10.2196/37007 [doi]
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been occurring concurrently with aninfodemic of misinformation about the virus. Spreading primarily on social media,there has been a significant academic effort to understand the English side ofthis infodemic. However, much less attention has been paid to the Arabic side.Objective: There is an urgent need to examine the scale of Arabic COVID-19disinformation. This study empirically examines how Arabic speakers use specific hashtags on Twitter to express antivaccine and antipandemic views to uncovertrends in their social media usage. By exploring this topic, we aim to fill a gapin the literature that can help understand conspiracies in Arabic aroundCOVID-19. Methods: This study used content analysis to understand how 13 popular Arabic hashtags were used in antivaccine communities. We used Twitter AcademicAPI v2 to search for the hashtags from the beginning of August 1, 2006, untilOctober 10, 2021. After downloading a large data set from Twitter, we identified major categories or topics in the sample data set using emergent coding. Emergentcoding was chosen because of its ability to inductively identify the themes that repeatedly emerged from the data set. Then, after revising the coding scheme, we coded the rest of the tweets and examined the results. In the second attempt and with a modified codebook, an acceptable intercoder agreement was reached(Krippendorff alpha>/=.774). Results: In total, we found 476,048 tweets, mostlyposted in 2021. First, the topic of infringing on civil liberties (n=483, 41.1%) covers ways that governments have allegedly infringed on civil liberties duringthe pandemic and unfair restrictions that have been imposed on unvaccinatedindividuals. Users here focus on topics concerning their civil liberties andfreedoms, claiming that governments violated such rights following the pandemic. Notably, users denounce government efforts to force them to take any of theCOVID-19 vaccines for different reasons. This was followed by vaccine-relatedconspiracies (n=476, 40.5%), including a Deep State dictating pandemic policies, mistrusting vaccine efficacy, and discussing unproven treatments. Although users tweeted about a range of different conspiracy theories, mistrusting the vaccine'sefficacy, false or exaggerated claims about vaccine risks and vaccine-relateddiseases, and governments and pharmaceutical companies profiting from vaccinesand intentionally risking the general public health appeared the most. Finally,calls for action (n=149, 12.6%) encourage individuals to participate in civildemonstrations. These calls range from protesting to encouraging other users totake action about the vaccine mandate. For each of these categories, we alsoattempted to trace the logic behind the different categories by exploringdifferent types of conspiracy theories for each category. Conclusions: Based onour findings, we were able to identify 3 prominent topics that were prevalentamongst Arabic speakers on Twitter. These categories focused on violations ofcivil liberties by governments, conspiracy theories about the vaccines, and callsfor action. Our findings also highlight the need for more research to betterunderstand the impact of COVID-19 disinformation on the Arab world.

PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1007/s11042-022-13368-z [doi]
AB  - Research aimed at finding solutions to the problem of the diffusion of distinctforms of non-genuine information online across multiple domains has attractedgrowing interest in recent years, from opinion spam to fake news detection.Currently, partly due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak and the subsequentproliferation of unfounded claims and highly biased content, attention hasfocused on developing solutions that can automatically assess the genuineness of health information. Most of these approaches, applied both to Web pages andsocial media content, rely primarily on the use of handcrafted features inconjunction with Machine Learning. In this article, instead, we propose a health misinformation detection model that exploits as features the embeddedrepresentations of some structural and content characteristics of Web pages,which are obtained using an embedding model pre-trained on medical data. Suchfeatures are employed within a deep learning classification model, whichcategorizes genuine health information versus health misinformation. The purpose of this article is therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model,namely Vec4Cred, with respect to the problem considered. This model represents anevolution of a previous one, with respect to which new features and architecturalchoices have been considered and illustrated in this work.

PG  - 7833516
LID - 10.1155/2022/7833516 [doi]
AB  - X-ray images aid medical professionals in the diagnosis and detection ofpathologies. They are critical, for example, in the diagnosis of pneumonia, thedetection of masses, and, more recently, the detection of COVID-19-relatedconditions. The chest X-ray is one of the first imaging tests performed whenpathology is suspected because it is one of the most accessible radiologicalexaminations. Deep learning-based neural networks, particularly convolutionalneural networks, have exploded in popularity in recent years and have becomeindispensable tools for image classification. Transfer learning approaches, inparticular, have enabled the use of previously trained networks' knowledge,eliminating the need for large data sets and lowering the high computationalcosts associated with this type of network. This research focuses on using deeplearning-based neural networks to detect anomalies in chest X-rays. Differentconvolutional network-based approaches are investigated using the ChestX-ray14database, which contains over 100,000 X-ray images with labels relating to 14different pathologies, and different classification objectives are evaluated.Starting with the pretrained networks VGG19, ResNet50, and Inceptionv3, networks based on transfer learning are implemented, with different schemes for theclassification stage and data augmentation. Similarly, an ad hoc architecture is proposed and evaluated without transfer learning for the classification objectivewith more examples. The results show that transfer learning produces acceptableresults in most of the tested cases, indicating that it is a viable first stepfor using deep networks when there are not enough labeled images, which is acommon problem when working with medical images. The ad hoc network, on the otherhand, demonstrated good generalization with data augmentation and an acceptableaccuracy value. The findings suggest that using convolutional neural networkswith and without transfer learning to design classifiers for detectingpathologies in chest X-rays is a good idea.

AB  - Scientists and regular citizens alike search for ways to manage the widespreadeffects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While scientists are busy in their labs, other citizens often turn to online sources to report their experiences and concernsand to seek and share knowledge of the virus. The text generated by those usersin online social media platforms can provide valuable insights about evolvingusers' opinions and attitudes. The objective of this research is to analyze text of such user disclosures to study human communication during a pandemic in fourprimary ways. First, we analyze Twitter tweet information, generated throughoutthe pandemic, to understand users' communications concerning COVID-19 and howthose communications have evolved during the pandemic. Second, we analyzelinguistic sentiment concepts (analytic, authentic, clout, and tone concepts) in different Twitter settings (sentiment in tweets with pictures or no pictures and tweets versus retweets). Third, we investigate the relationship between Twittertweets with additional forms of internet activity, namely, Google searches andWikipedia page views. Finally, we create and use a dictionary of specificCOVID-19-related concepts (e.g., symptom of lost taste) to assess how the use of those concepts in tweets are related to the spread of information and theresulting influence of Twitter users. The analysis showed a surprisingly lack of emotion in the initial phases of the pandemic as people were information seeking.As time progressed, there were more expressions of sentiment, including anger.Further, tweets with and without pictures and/or video had statisticallysignificant differences in text sentiment characteristics. Similarly, there were differences between the sentiment in tweets and retweets and tweets. We alsofound that Google and Wikipedia searches were predictive of sentiment in thetweets. Finally, a variable representing a dictionary of COVID-related conceptswas statistically significant when related to users' Twitter influence score and number of retweets, illustrating the general impact of COVID-19 on Twitter andhuman communication. Overall, the results provide insights into humancommunication as well as models of human internet and social media use. Thesefindings could be useful for the management of global challenges beyond, ordifferent from, a pandemic.

AB  - Objective: The novel coronavirus nucleic acid results are the core indicators of illness monitoring. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship betweenimmunological features and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by analyzing theclinical and immunological features in nonsevere COVID-19 cases. Methods: Datafrom nonsevere COVID-19 patients admitted to Haihe Hospital from May 2020 to June2021 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: (1) A total of 122cases were reviewed in the present study, including 38 mild and 84 moderatecases. The average age of mild cases was significantly different from moderatecases (P < 0.001). Eight patients complained of hyposmia and it was more frequentin mild cases (P < 0.001). The nucleic acid positive duration (NPD) of nonsevere novel coronavirus was 20.49 (confidence interval (CI) 17.50-3.49) days. (2) Thelevels of specific IgM and IgG for COVID-19 were higher in mild cases than inmoderate cases (P=0.023 and P=0.047, respectively). (3) The correlation analysis with antibodies and T-cell subtypes showed that the lymphocyte (LYM) count, Tcells, CD4(+)T cells, and CD8(+)T cells had a linear correlation with NPD. (4)Among the 93 patients monitored, 62 COVID-19 cases presented a progressive riseof specific IgM and IgG. The daily increase rates of IgM and IgG were 38.42% (CI 28.22-48.61%) and 24.90% (CI 0.23-29.58%), respectively. Conclusion: The levelsand daily increase rates of specific IgM and IgG against the virus can varybetween cases. The NPD presented a linear correlation with the LYM, T cells,CD4(+)T cells, and CD8+T cells. Hence, more attention should be paid to theseindicators in clinical practice.

LID - 10.1016/j.csbj.2022.07.042 [doi]
AB  - Co-infection of RNA viruses may contribute to their recombination and causesevere clinical symptoms. However, the tracking and identification of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection persist as challenges. Due to the lack of methods for detectingco-infected samples in a large amount of deep sequencing data, the lineagecomposition, spatial-temporal distribution, and frequency of SARS-CoV-2co-infection events in the population remains unclear. Here, we propose ahypergeometric distribution-based method named Cov2Coinfect with the ability todecode the lineage composition from 50,809 deep sequencing data. By resolving themutational patterns in each sample, Cov2Coinfect can precisely determine theco-infected SARS-CoV-2 variants from deep sequencing data. Results from twoindependent and parallel projects in the United States achieved a similarco-infection rate of 0.3% approximately 0.5% in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples.Notably, all co-infected variants were highly consistent with the co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the regional epidemiology, demonstrating that theco-circulation of different variants is an essential prerequisite forco-infection. Overall, our study not only provides a robust method to identifythe co-infected SARS-CoV-2 variants from sequencing samples, but also highlights the urgent need to pay more attention to co-infected patients for better disease prevention and control.

AB  - This research estimated the optimal size and composition of the portfolio, andits benefit-cost ratio, of COVID-19 vaccines that Colombia should negotiate as a price-taking country. The Advance Market Commitments (AMC) mathematical model wasapplied using the parameters from the Colombian context and from a literaturereview. The findings indicate that the optimal portfolio of Colombia shouldinclude 13 vaccines, mainly from two platforms: i) RNA and ii) inactivated virus.The benefit-cost ratio was always greater than one in the baseline scenario andafter performing many sensitivity analyses on parameters such as the percentageof the population at risk, the price per treatment, and the herd immunitythreshold, among others. In a context of high uncertainty, the best decision -with high benefit - is to anticipate the negotiation processes with the providersof COVID-19 vaccines, which will generate positive economic and health impacts.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is theetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 340 million people since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019, resulting inapproximately 55 million deaths. The rapid and effective diagnosis of COVID-19patients is vital to prevent the spread of the disease. In a previous study, wereported a novel temperature-responsive liposome-linked immunosorbent assay(TLip-LISA) using biotinylated-TLip that exhibited high detection sensitivity forthe prostate-specific antigen. Herein, we used immunoglobulin-TLip (IgG-TLip), inwhich the antibodies were directly conjugated to the liposomal surface tosimplify pretreatment procedures and reduce the detection time for SARS-CoV-2.The results indicated that TLip-LISA could detect the recombinant nucleocapsidprotein and the nucleocapsid protein in inactivated virus with 20 min incubation time in total, and the limit of detection was calculated to be 2.2 and 1.0 pg/mL,respectively. Therefore, TLip-LISA has high potential to be used in clinic forrapid diagnosis and disease control.

TI  - EXPLAINABLE FEATURES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGH OR LOW SPREAD OF SARS-COV-2: AFRICAIN VIEW.
PG  - e01301
LID - 10.1016/j.sciaf.2022.e01301 [doi]
AB  - The low spread of the global pandemic in Africa has raised concerns.Consequently, many commentators have misconstrued concerns suspecting weather,and immunity to be prime reasons. This study investigates the factors associated with the high & low spread of the SARS-CoV-2 (also known as COVID-19) and employsgraphical Bayesian models to investigate feature interactions and causality.Through experimentation with the Bayesian framework, we propose that: (i) theproportion of people within the country population who test positive forSARS-CoV-2 and a country's test capacity cause the rate of spread of the virus[i.e., P(S|P) & P(S|T)] (ii) poverty gaps, welfare and freedom of the pressdirectly cause the spread of the virus [i.e., P(S|E), P(S|W), & P(S|R)] (iii)Government effectiveness serves as a parent to poverty gaps and welfare [ i.e.,P(E|G) & P(W|G)] and voice and accountability serve as a parent to freedom of thepress [i.e., P(R|V)]. For the output, we "dichotomized" regions based on the"share of global infection rate" metric (SGIR) that implicitly accounts for agiven region's population, and we find that - out of two hundred and nineteencountries investigated, one hundred and twenty-seven have SGIR >/= 1%, and themajority (44 out 58 - 75.86%) of Africa countries (as at 12th February 2021) haveSGIR < 1%. With Africa in the mirror, the study shows that only 2.2% of theAfrica population has been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and finds that the lowproportion of population tested [i.e., P(S|P)] for SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of thelow spread (i.e., cases reported) of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa. Similarly, thefragmented socioeconomic statuses [i.e., P(S|E)] among citizens leads tosocioeconomic distancing, causing socio-class gaps between the rich andpoor/average citizens, ensuring low interaction in social space, thus limitingthe spread.

AB  - We conducted a systematic literature review on the ethical considerations of the use of contact tracing app technology, which was extensively implemented duringthe COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid and extensive use of this technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, while benefiting the public well-being by providinginformation about people's mobility and movements to control the spread of thevirus, raised several ethical concerns for the post-COVID-19 era. To investigate these concerns for the post-pandemic situation and provide direction for futureevents, we analyzed the current ethical frameworks, research, and case studiesabout the ethical usage of tracing app technology. The results suggest there are seven essential ethical considerations-privacy, security, acceptability,government surveillance, transparency, justice, and voluntariness-in the ethical use of contact tracing technology. In this paper, we explain and discuss theseconsiderations and how they are needed for the ethical usage of this technology. The findings also highlight the importance of developing integrated guidelinesand frameworks for implementation of such technology in the post- COVID-19 world.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary materialavailable at 10.1007/s10676-022-09659-6.

AB  - The risk of developing COVID-19 and its variants may be higher in those withpre-existing health conditions such as thyroid disease, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), breast tissue disease, chronic dermatitis, and other severe infections. Early andprecise identification of these disorders is critical. A huge number of patients in nations like India require early and rapid testing as a preventative measure. The problem of imbalance arises from the skewed nature of data in which theinstances from majority class are classified correct, while the minority class isunfortunately misclassified by many classifiers. When it comes to human life,this kind of misclassification is unacceptable. To solve the misclassificationissue and improve accuracy in such datasets, we applied a variety of databalancing techniques to several machine learning algorithms. The outcomes areencouraging, with a considerable increase in accuracy. As an outcome of theseproper diagnoses, we can make plans and take the required actions to stoppatients from acquiring serious health issues or viral infections.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) is a subtype of gastriccancer morphologically characterized by massive lymphocyte infiltration. Weherein report the short-term outcomes of three rare cases of intramucosal EBVaGC treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Histologically, the lesions exhibited poorly to moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma withoutlymphovascular invasion, and in situ hybridization revealed EBV-encoded smallRNA. Helicobacter pylori infection was not found in any of the lesions. Duringthe 3 to 12 months of follow-up following ESD, none of the ESD-treated patientsshowed evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases. Essentialcharacteristics of intramucosal EBVaGC may include lymphocyte infiltration intothe mucosal stroma or cancer nests as well as the presence of a lace pattern. We believe that ESD might be a safe and suitable treatment method for intramucosalEBVaGC that avoids needless surgery, particularly in patients with severecomorbidities or a high operational risk.

AB  - The gut microbiome is intricately coupled with immune regulation and metabolism, but its role in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood.Severe and fatal COVID-19 is characterized by poor anti-viral immunity andhypercoagulation, particularly in males. Here, we define multiple pathways bywhich the gut microbiome protects mammalian hosts from SARS-CoV-2 intranasalinfection, both locally and systemically, via production of short-chain fattyacids (SCFAs). SCFAs reduced viral burdens in the airways and intestines bydownregulating the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), and enhancing adaptive immunity via GPR41 and 43 in male animals. Wefurther identify a novel role for the gut microbiome in regulating systemiccoagulation response by limiting megakaryocyte proliferation and plateletturnover via the Sh2b3-Mpl axis. Taken together, our findings have unravelednovel functions of SCFAs and fiber-fermenting gut bacteria to dampen viral entry and hypercoagulation and promote adaptive antiviral immunity.

TI  - Intubation strategy in COVID-19 era: An observational study.
LID - 10.4103/jmas.jmas_11_22 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aims: Aerosol protection equipment aim at protecting theanaesthesiologist, from aerosol-borne infections, namely, severe acuterespiratory syndrome corona virus-2. Methods: We improvised the first-generation intubation box (IB) by increasing its dimensions, including heat and moistureexchanger with filter, suction catheter, and attaching arm sleeves to make amodified intubation box (MIB). The impact of IB, MIB and transparent sheets (TS) on the patient outcomes during airway management was evaluated. Results: Asignificant difference in median (interquartile range in minutes) was observed intime to intubate between IB (4 [4-5]); TS (0.5 [0.3-0.5]) and MIB (0.3[0.3-1.5]): P = 0.004); and airway devices; McCoy (0.5 [0.3-2]), CMac (0.5[0.3-1.5]): P = 0.004. First-pass success was 100% with the TS, whereas more thanthree attempts were required with IB 66.7% and 5.2% with MIB. Video laryngoscope was associated with less airway-related adverse events (ARAEs). The need for maskventilation (and hence possible aerosolisation) was maximum with IB. All theARAEs resolved uneventfully. No breach of personal protective equipment wasobserved; none of the health-care professionals involved in patient caredeveloped any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Conclusion: Video laryngoscope is favourable for managing airway in COVID-19 times. In view of the ongoing pandemicand added protection that it offers, it is worthwhile to include the MIB in thearmamentarium for managing the airway of patients with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is an important strategy for controlling virus outbreaks onuniversity campuses during the COVID-19 pandemic but testing participation rates can be low. The Residence-Based Testing Participation Pilot (RB-TPP) was a novel intervention implemented at two student residences on a large UK universitycampus over 4 weeks. The aim of the pilot was to increase the frequency ofasymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 saliva testing onsite. This process evaluation aimed todetermine whether RB-TPP was implemented as planned and identify implementationbarriers and facilitators. METHODS: A mixed-methods process evaluation wasconducted alongside the RB-TPP. Evaluation participants were students (opting in,or out of RB-TPP) and staff with a role in service provision or student support. Monitoring data were collected from the intervention delivery team and meetingrecords. Data were collected from students via online survey (n = 152) and seven focus groups (n = 30), and from staff via individual interviews (n = 13).Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and qualitative data thematically. Barriers and facilitators to implementation were mapped to the 'Capability,Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour' (COM-B) behaviour change framework. RESULTS:Four hundred sixty-four students opted to participate in RB-TPP (98% of students living onsite). RB-TPP was implemented broadly as planned but relaxed socialdistancing was terminated early due to concerns relating to national escalationof the COVID-19 Delta variant, albeit testing continued. Most students (97.9%)perceived the period of relaxed social distancing within residences positively.The majority engaged in asymptomatic testing (88%); 46% (52% of testers) werefully compliant with pre-determined testing frequency. Implementation wasfacilitated by convenience and efficiency of testing, and reduction in thenegative impacts of isolation through opportunities for students to socialise.Main barriers to implementation were perceived mixed-messages about the rules,ambivalent attitudes, and lack of adherence to COVID-19 protective measures inthe minority. CONCLUSIONS: This process evaluation identifies factors that helpor hinder the success of university residence-based outbreak prevention andmanagement strategies. RB-TPP led to increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 testingparticipation among students in university residences. Perceived normalisation ofuniversity life significantly enhanced student mental wellbeing. The complexityand challenge generated by multiple lines of communication and rapid adaptions toa changing pandemic context was evident. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UKAS307727-02-01; Pre-results.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dental education: digitalization - progressor regress? Example of an online hands-on course.
PG  - 591
LID - 10.1186/s12909-022-03638-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the accompanying contactrestrictions, a new challenge arose for dental education. Despite the limitedoverall situation, it must be ensured that, in addition to theoretical content,practical skills in particular continue to be taught. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and implement an online hands-on course for dental students that ensures practical training, even during the pandemic. METHODS: The newlydeveloped course was held from April 2020 to March 2021. A total of six groups(each consisting of approximately 40-50 students) took part in the course. Theparticipating students were in their 3rd, 4th or 5th year of study. The coursetaught theoretical basics (via an online platform) and promoted the learning ofpractical/surgical techniques on models such as bananas, pork bellies, or chickenthighs with live demonstrations (via ZOOM) and interactive post-preparation bystudents at home (and in a rotating small group of 3-7 students on site). Studentself-evaluation (at the beginning and end of the course) and course evaluationwere performed using questionnaires. The learning success was analyzed (throughself-evaluations) using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (significance level alpha =0.05). RESULTS: Concerning students self-evaluations, the theoretical knowledge, general surgical skills (such as surgical instrument handling), and specificsurgical skills (such as performing a kite flap) improved during the course, withsignificant results (p < 0.001 for each). About 60% of the students rated thecourse overall as excellent (grades 9 or 10 on a Likert scale of 1 to 10). Thetechnical implementation of the course was rated with a median of 9 (= very good,on a Likert scale of 1 to 10). 38.5% described the applicability of the skillslearned for their later professional life as extremely good. CONCLUSIONS: Theresults of this work suggest that, within the limitations of this study, theintroduced concept of an online hands-on course could be an appropriate form ofteaching practical dental skills, even during a pandemic. Further research isneeded in the field of digital education for dental students.

PG  - 51
LID - 10.1186/s12938-022-01013-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is one of the most common clinicalmanifestations of vulva. Thirteen percent of women have symptomatic vulvardiseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression profile ofcircular RNA (circRNAs) in vulvar lichen sclerosus, and to identify theunderlying core genes of VLS. METHODS: We removed rRNA for sequencing, andscreened the differentially expressed messenger RNA (mRNAs), long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) and single-stranded circRNA in 20 groups of VLS tissues and 20 groupsof healthy female vulvar skin tissues. Bioinformatics analysis was used toanalyze its potential functions. RESULTS: A total of 2545 differentiallyexpressed mRNAs were assessed in VLS patients, of which 1541 samples wereup-regulated and 1004 samples were down-regulated. A total of 1453 differentiallyexpressed lncRNAs were assessed, of which 812 samples were up-regulated and 641samples were down-regulated. A total of 79 differentially expressed circRNAs wereassessed, of which 54 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated. Thedifferential expression of circRNAs was closely related to biological processesand molecular functions. The differences in circRNAs were mainly related to the"human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection" signaling pathway and the "axonguidance" signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The profile of abnormal regulation ofcircRNA exists in VLS. According to biological informatics analysis, thedysregulation of circRNAs may be related to the pathogenesis and pathologicalprocess of VLS.

PG  - 1468
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13860-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) vaccine has been used in Hefei forseveral years, and the epidemiological significance of vaccination in this areais unclear. We aims to explore the spatial-temporal-demographic and virologicalchanges of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) after vaccination in China.METHODS: The data for HFMD from 2012 to 2020 were downloaded with the help ofHFMD reporting system of Hefei Center for Disease Control and Prevention andcombined with the EV-A71 vaccination status in Hefei. The study defined theperiod between 2012 to 2016 as the pre-vaccination period and explored the effectof vaccination on the incidence of HFMD by comparing the changes of HFMD beforeand after vaccination in terms of spatial, temporal, demographic and virological aspects. RESULTS: During the study period, a higher incidence occurred in urbanarea and the random distribution changed to a slight cluster after vaccination.HFMD incidence had inconsistent seasonality over years, with one or two incidencepeaks in varying years. The morbidity decreased from 215.22/105 in 2012-2016 to179.81/105 in 2017-2020 (p < 0.001). Boys, 0-4 years old children and Scatteredchildren were more susceptible to HFMD compared with the others, the proportions decreased after vaccination except in Scattered children. The main pathogenicenterovirus gradually changed from EV-A71 to Other Enteroviruses, especiallycoxsackieviruses A6 (CV-A6) after the implementation of EV-A71 vaccination.CONCLUSIONS: The EV-A71 vaccine was effective in reducing the incidence of HFMDand changing the spatial, temporal, demographic, and virological characteristic. These changes should be considered during the vaccination implementation tofurther reduce the disease burden of HFMD.

AB  - Headache is among the most frequent symptoms persisting or newly developing aftercoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as part of the so-called long COVID syndrome.The knowledge on long COVID headache is still limited, however growing evidenceis defining the features of this novel condition, in particular regardingclinical characteristics, some pathophysiological mechanisms and first treatment recommendations. Long COVID headache can present in the form of worsening of apreexisting primary headache, or, more specifically, in the form of a new(intermittent or daily) headache starting during the acute infection or after adelay. It often presents together with other long COVID symptoms, most frequentlywith hyposmia. It can manifest with a migrainous or, more frequently, with atension-type-like phenotype. Persistent activation of the immune system andtrigeminovascular activation are thought to play a role. As there are virtuallyno treatment studies, treatment currently is largely guided by the existingguidelines for primary headaches with the corresponding phenotype. The presentreport, a collaborative work of the international group of the Junior EditorialBoard of The Journal of Headache and Pain aims to summarize the most recentevidence about long COVID headache and suggests approaches to the diagnosis andtreatment of this disorder.

TI  - Modelling of a triage scoring tool for SARS-COV-2 PCR testing in health-careworkers: data from the first German COVID-19 Testing Unit in Munich.
PG  - 664
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07627-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous scoring tools have been developed for assessing theprobability of SARS-COV-2 test positivity, though few being suitable or adaptedfor outpatient triage of health care workers. METHODS: We retrospectivelyanalysed 3069 patient records of health care workers admitted to the COVID-19Testing Unit of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat of Munich between January 27and September 30, 2020, for real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of naso-or oropharyngeal swabs. Variables for a multivariable logistic regression modelwere collected from self-completed case report forms and selected throughstepwise backward selection. Internal validation was conducted by bootstrapping. We then created a weighted point-scoring system from logistic regressioncoefficients. RESULTS: 4076 (97.12%) negative and 121 (2.88%) positive testresults were analysed. The majority were young (mean age: 38.0), female (69.8%)and asymptomatic (67.8%). Characteristics that correlated with PCR-positivityincluded close-contact professions (physicians, nurses, physiotherapists),flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, rhinorrhoea, headache), abdominal symptoms(nausea/emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhoea), less days since symptom onset, andcontact to a SARS-COV-2 positive index-case. Variables selected for the finalmodel included symptoms (fever, cough, abdominal pain, anosmia/ageusia) andexposures (to SARS-COV-positive individuals and, specifically, to positivepatients). Internal validation by bootstrapping yielded a corrected Area Underthe Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve of 76.43%. We present sensitivityand specificity at different prediction cut-off points. In a subgroup withfurther workup, asthma seems to have a protective effect with regard to testingresult positivity and measured temperature was found to be less predictive thananamnestic fever. CONCLUSIONS: We consider low threshold testing for health care workers a valuable strategy for infection control and are able to provide aneasily applicable triage score for the assessment of the probability of infectionin health care workers in case of resource scarcity.

TI  - Hypercompact adenine base editors based on transposase B guided by engineeredRNA.
LID - 10.1038/s41589-022-01077-5 [doi]
AB  - Transposon-associated transposase B (TnpB) is deemed an ancestral protein fortype V, Cas12 family members, and the closest ancestor to UnCas12f1. Previously, we reported a set of engineered guide RNAs supporting high indel efficiency forCas12f1 in human cells. Here we suggest a new technology whereby the engineeredguide RNAs also manifest high-efficiency programmable endonuclease activity forTnpB. We have termed this technology TaRGET (TnpB-augment RNA-based GenomeEditing Technology). Having this feature in mind, we established TnpB-basedadenine base editors (ABEs). A Tad-Tad mutant (V106W, D108Q) dimer fused to the Cterminus of dTnpB (D354A) showed the highest levels of A-to-G conversion. Thelimited targetable sites for TaRGET-ABE were expanded with engineered variants ofTnpB or optimized deaminases. Delivery of TaRGET-ABE also ensured potent A-to-Gconversion rates in mammalian genomes. Collectively, the TaRGET-ABE willcontribute to improving precise genome-editing tools that can be delivered byadeno-associated viruses, thereby harnessing the development of clusteredregularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based gene therapy.

LID - 10.1038/s41433-022-02169-1 [doi]
AB  - The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) system is an adaptive immune defencesystem that has gradually evolved in bacteria and archaea to combat invadingviruses and exogenous DNA. Advances in technology have enabled researchers toenhance their understanding of the immune process in vivo and its potential foruse in genome editing. Thus far, applications of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editingtechnology in ophthalmology have included gene therapy for corneal dystrophy,glaucoma, congenital cataract, Leber's congenital amaurosis, retinitispigmentosa, Usher syndrome, fundus neovascular disease, proliferativevitreoretinopathy, retinoblastoma and other eye diseases. Additionally, thecombination of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology with adeno-associated virus vector and inducible pluripotent stem cells provides further therapeutic avenues for the treatment of eye diseases. Nonetheless, many challenges remain in thedevelopment of clinically feasible retinal genome editing therapy. This reviewdiscusses the development, as well as mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9 and itsapplications and challenges in gene therapy for eye diseases.

AB  - HIV-infected individuals could be at a greater risk for developing lung cancerthan the general population due to the higher prevalence in the former of humanpapillomavirus (HPV) in the oral cavity and higher smoking rates. Our aim was to assess HPV prevalence and E6 viral oncogene transcription in lung cancer samples from HIV-infected individuals. This was a single-center, retrospective study of acohort of HIV-1-infected patients diagnosed with and treated for lung cancer.Pathological lung samples archived as smears or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were subjected to HPV genotyping, detection of human p16 protein andassessment for HPV E6 mRNA expression. Lung cancer samples from 41 patients were studied, including squamous cell carcinoma (32%), adenocarcinoma (34%), non-smallcell cancer (27%), and small cell cancer (7%). HPV DNA was detected in 23 out of 41 (56%, 95% CI 41-70%) of samples and high-risk (HR)-HPV types were detected in 16 out of 41 (39%, 95% CI 26-54%), HPV-16 being the most prevalent [13/16 (81.3%,95% CI 57.0-93%]. In samples with sufficient material left: expression of p16 wasdetected in 3 out of 10 (30%) of HR-HPV DNA-positive tumors and in 3 out of 7(43%) of the negative ones; and E6 mRNA was detected in 2 out of 10 (20%) ofHPV-16-positive samples (squamous lung cancers). These two patients had abackground of a previous HPV-related neoplasia and smoking. HR-HPV DNA detection was prevalent in lung cancers in HIV-infected patients. However, viral oncogeneexpression was limited to patients with previous HPV-related cancers.

AB  - Sputnik-V (Gam-COVID-Vac) is a heterologous, recombinant adenoviral (rAdv)vector-based, COVID-19 vaccine now used in > 70 countries. Yet there is ashortage of data on this vaccine's performance in diverse populations. Here, weperformed a prospective cohort study to assess the reactogenicity and immunologicoutcomes of Sputnik-V vaccination in Kazakhstan. COVID-19-free participants (n = 82 at baseline) were followed at day 21 after Sputnik-V dose 1 (rAd5) and dose 2 (rAd26). Self-reported local and systemic adverse events were captured usingquestionnaires. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to performSARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and immunologic assays. We observed that most of thereported adverse events were mild-to-moderate injection site or systemicreactions, no severe or potentially life-threatening conditions were reported,and dose 1 appeared to be more reactogenic than dose 2. The seroconversion ratewas 97% post-dose 1, remaining the same post-dose 2. The proportion ofparticipants with detectable virus neutralization was 83% post-dose 1, increasingto 98% post-dose 2, with the largest relative increase observed in participantswithout prior COVID-19 exposure. Dose 1 boosted nasal S-IgG and S-IgA, while the boosting effect of dose 2 on mucosal S-IgG, but not S-IgA, was only observed insubjects without prior COVID-19. Systemically, vaccination reduced serum levelsof growth regulated oncogene (GRO), which correlated with an elevation in bloodplatelet count. Overall, Sputnik-V dose 1 elicited both blood and mucosalSARS-CoV-2 immunity, while the immune boosting effect of dose 2 was minimal.Thus, adjustments to the current vaccine dosing regimen are necessary to optimizeimmunization efficacy and cost-effectiveness. While Sputnik-V reactogenicity issimilar to that of other COVID-19 vaccines, the induced alterations to theGRO/platelet axis warrant investigation of the vaccine's effects on systemicimmunology.

AB  - Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) characterized by the absence ofdetectable HBsAg in the presence of HBV DNA in the serum and/or liver tissueremains a potential risk of transmission and diseases progression among differentpopulation groups. It could be associated with asymptomatic case up to chronicliver disease (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of thisstudy was to assess the magnitude and characteristics of OBI among patients with CLD of unidentified cause in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study was conducted atthe gastroenterology & hepatology referral clinic of three government and twoprivate hospitals in Addis Ababa. Known CLD patients as evidenced by clinical andimaging criteria and/or with HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative results usingrapid test kit were included. ELISA serological test to anti-HBc Ab, anti HBsAgAb, and HBsAg were determined using BIORAD kits [ https://www.bio-rad.com ].HBV-DNA was amplified, and viral loads were determined by quantitative real-time PCR using Abbott m2000rt platform following the manufacturer's instructions. Dataanalysis was done using SPSS version 20.A total of 48 CLD patients with noidentified cause for their liver disease were identified during the study period.All the patients had evidence of CLD by clinical and imaging criteria and ninewere excluded. Three (7.69%) of the 39 patients tested positive for HBsAg testdone by ELISA making the negative predictive value of the rapid test kits 92.3%compared to ELISA. The remaining 36 patients had serology test for HBV and 16(44.4%) had positive anti-HBV core antibody. Two (5.56%) of the 36 patients with HBV viral load determination had detectable HBV DNA suggesting presence of anoccult hepatitis B infection. Occult hepatitis B infection is found to be anaetiology among CLD patients labelled as having no identified cause by thecurrent standard of care using rapid HBsAg kits in a subset of patients inEthiopia. This study signifies the high rate of OBI and past evidence of HBVinfection among CLD patients and thus nucleic acid testing and/or anti-HBc shall be integrated to the routine health care system to minimize HBV infection risk oftransmission and to enhance patient care.

PG  - 261
LID - 10.1038/s41392-022-01118-4 [doi]
AB  - Apolipoprotein E (APOE) plays a pivotal role in lipid including cholesterolmetabolism. The APOE epsilon4 (APOE4) allele is a major genetic risk factor forAlzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases. Although APOE has recently beenassociated with increased susceptibility to infections of several viruses,whether and how APOE and its isoforms affect SARS-CoV-2 infection remainsunclear. Here, we show that serum concentrations of APOE correlate inversely withlevels of cytokine/chemokine in 73 COVID-19 patients. Utilizing multiple protein interaction assays, we demonstrate that APOE3 and APOE4 interact with theSARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2; and APOE/ACE2 interactions require zincmetallopeptidase domain of ACE2, a key docking site for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.In addition, immuno-imaging assays using confocal, super-resolution, andtransmission electron microscopies reveal that both APOE3 and APOE4 reduceACE2/Spike-mediated viral entry into cells. Interestingly, while having acomparable binding affinity to ACE2, APOE4 inhibits viral entry to a lesserextent compared to APOE3, which is likely due to APOE4's more compact structureand smaller spatial obstacle to compete against Spike binding to ACE2.Furthermore, APOE epsilon4 carriers clinically correlate with increasedSARS-CoV-2 infection and elevated serum inflammatory factors in 142 COVID-19patients assessed. Our study suggests a regulatory mechanism underlyingSARS-CoV-2 infection through APOE interactions with ACE2, which may explain inpart increased COVID-19 infection and disease severity in APOE epsilon4 carriers.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have continuously evolved and may erode vaccineinduced immunity. In this observational cohort study, we determine the risk ofbreakthrough infection in a fully vaccinated cohort. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgGlevels were measured before first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and at day 21-28, 90 and180, as well as after booster vaccination. Breakthrough infections were captured through the Danish National Microbiology database. incidence rate ratio (IRR) forbreakthrough infection at time-updated anti-spike IgG levels was determined usingPoisson regression. Among 6076 participants, 127 and 364 breakthrough infections due to Delta and Omicron variants were observed. IRR was 0.29 (95% CI 0.15-0.56) for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant, comparing the highest andlowest quintiles of anti-spike IgG. For Omicron, no significant differences inIRR were observed. These results suggest that quantitative level of anti-spikeIgG have limited impact on the risk of breakthrough infection with Omicron.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate a vaccine technology with potential to protect againstcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and reduce transmission of severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with a single vaccine dose, wedeveloped a SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine using the live vesicular stomatitisvirus (VSV) chimeric virus approach previously used to develop a licensed Ebolavirus vaccine. METHODS: We generated a replication-competent chimericVSV-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate by replacing the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene with coding sequence for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S). Immunogenicity of the lead vaccine candidate (VSVG-SARS-CoV-2) was evaluated in cotton rats and golden Syrian hamsters, and protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection also was assessed inhamsters. FINDINGS: VSVG-SARS-CoV-2 delivered with a single intramuscular (IM)injection was immunogenic in cotton rats and hamsters and protected hamsters fromweight loss following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. When mucosal vaccination wasevaluated, cotton rats did not respond to the vaccine, whereas mucosaladministration of VSVG-SARS-CoV-2 was found to be more immunogenic than IMinjection in hamsters and induced immunity that significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus loads in both lung and nasal tissues. INTERPRETATION:VSVG-SARS-CoV-2 delivered by IM injection or mucosal administration wasimmunogenic in golden Syrian hamsters, and both vaccination methods effectivelyprotected the lung from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hamsters vaccinated by mucosalapplication of VSVG-SARS-CoV-2 also developed immunity that controlled SARS-CoV-2replication in nasal tissue. FUNDING: The study was funded by Merck Sharp &Dohme, Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA, and TheInternational AIDS Vaccine Initiative, Inc. (IAVI), New York, USA. Parts of this research was supported by the Biomedical Advanced Research and DevelopmentAuthority (BARDA) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) of the USDepartment of Defense.

AB  - PURPOSE: HBV DNA quantification is used for individuals with uninterpretableserological tests, occult HBV infections, decreasing the window period of thedisease, and treatment follow-up. Although there are commercial qPCR assays, theyare expensive. In this study, we developed a highly sensitive quantitative TaqManReal-Time PCR with an exogenous internal control to quantify HBV DNA inserum/plasma. METHODS: A specific primer/probe set was designed for the Sconserved region of various HBV genotypes. The primer/probe set was evaluatedexperimentally and in-silico. An exogenous internal control was included tomonitor the effects of inhibitors. The standard plasmid was titrated using three different methods to prepare the seven standards for the assay. The functionalcharacteristics of the in-house assay were evaluated using the standards. Twohundred clinical specimens were also tested. RESULTS: The LOD of the in-houseassay was 40 IU/mL, and the assay was linear from 3.26Log10 to 9.26Log10 IU/mL.The analytical and clinical sensitivity of the assay was 100% and 92.15%,respectively. The analytical and clinical specificity of the assay was 100% and98.97%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the assaywere determined to be 98.94% and 92.38%, respectively. The highest coefficient ofvariation of the inter/intra-assay was 5.1%. The accuracy was close to 100% forall standards, and the correlation between the in-house assay and commercial kit AltoStar(R) PCR Kits 1.5 was remarkable. The results of the clinical samplesusing the standards titrated using AcroMetrix HBV Panel, Artus(R) HBV RG PCR Kit,and AltoStar(R) PCR Kits 1.5 were comparable (r = 0.942, 0.951, 0.951).CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the in-house assay is highly sensitive andspecific, reproducible, and cost-benefit. Thus, it can be used to detect andquantify HBV DNA in research and clinical settings.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, responsible for the severe acuterespiratory syndrome known as COVID-19, has rapidly spread in almost everycountry and devastated the global economy and health care system. Lung injury is an early disease manifestation believed to be a major contributor to short- andlong-term pathological consequences of COVID-19, and thus drug discovery aimingto ameliorate lung injury could be a potential strategy to treat COVID-19patients. By inducing a severe acute respiratory syndrome-like pulmonary disease model through infecting A/J mice with murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1), weshow that i.v. administration of pazopanib ameliorates acute lung injurieswithout affecting MHV-1 replication. Pazopanib reduces cell apoptosis inMHV-1-infected lungs. Furthermore, we also identified that pazopanib has to begiven no later than 48 h after the virus infection without compromising thetherapeutic effect. Our study provides a potential treatment forcoronavirus-induced lung injuries and support for further evaluation of pazopanibin COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 vaccination inKenya.
LID - e009430 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2022-009430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A few studies have assessed the epidemiological impact and thecost-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in settings where most of the population had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted acost-effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 vaccine in Kenya from a societalperspective over a 1.5-year time frame. An age-structured transmission modelassumed at least 80% of the population to have prior natural immunity when animmune escape variant was introduced. We examine the effect of slow (18 months)or rapid (6 months) vaccine roll-out with vaccine coverage of 30%, 50% or 70% of the adult (>18 years) population prioritising roll-out in those over 50-years(80% uptake in all scenarios). Cost data were obtained from primary analyses. We assumed vaccine procurement at US$7 per dose and vaccine delivery costs ofUS$3.90-US$6.11 per dose. The cost-effectiveness threshold was US$919.11.FINDINGS: Slow roll-out at 30% coverage largely targets those over 50 years andresulted in 54% fewer deaths (8132 (7914-8373)) than no vaccination and was cost saving (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER=US$-1343 (US$-1345 toUS$-1341) per disability-adjusted life-year, DALY averted). Increasing coverageto 50% and 70%, further reduced deaths by 12% (810 (757-872) and 5% (282(251-317) but was not cost-effective, using Kenya's cost-effectiveness threshold (US$919.11). Rapid roll-out with 30% coverage averted 63% more deaths and wasmore cost-saving (ICER=US$-1607 (US$-1609 to US$-1604) per DALY averted) comparedwith slow roll-out at the same coverage level, but 50% and 70% coverage scenarioswere not cost-effective. INTERPRETATION: With prior exposure partially protectingmuch of the Kenyan population, vaccination of young adults may no longer becost-effective.

AB  - There are few studies on the severity and prognosis of patients infected with thesevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant.From January 11, 2022 to January 25, 2022, 181 patients were infected with theSARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in a single hospital in Korea. The initial clinicalcharacteristics were investigated through the COVID-19 basic investigation form. Outcomes were reviewed using medical records. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range 1-90), and 95 patients (52.5%) were male. None were re-infectedwith SARS-CoV-2, and 127 (70.2%) were fully vaccinated (boosted or within 6months after second vaccination). Forty-two patients (23.2%) were asymptomatic.Among symptomatic patients, the frequency of symptoms was as follows: cough(37.0%), sore throat (33.7%), and fever (30.4%). In terms of disease severity,168 (92.8%) patients did not require supplemental oxygen, 6 (3.3%) requiredlow-flow oxygen, 5 (2.8%) required high-flow oxygen, and 2 (1.1%) died. Four ofthe five individuals who required high-flow oxygen and the two who died were not vaccinated. Most of the patients who contracted the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variantexhibited mild clinical features; however, severe clinical features includingmortality were encountered among individuals who were not vaccinated.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of intervention policies on coronavirusdisease-19 (COVID-19) dissemination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An age-structuredcompartmental model for the COVID-19 outbreak was proposed to predict the impact of control measures in the Seoul/Gyeonggi region. The model was calibrated based on actual data and realistic situations, including daily vaccine doses,proportion of delta variant cases, and confirmed cases by age. We simulateddifferent scenarios for non-pharmaceutical interventions by varying socialdistancing and school attendance strategies. RESULTS: Two-step mitigation ofsocial distancing without in-person classes would result in a rapid increase inconfirmed cases up to 10000 but would keep severe cases within the manageablerange of the health care system. The overall impact of taking down the distancinglevel by one step with twice the increase in contacts at school was comparable tothe above scenario. Implementation of two-step mitigation of social distancingalong with a two-fold increase in contacts among the school-age group woulddramatically increase confirmed and severe cases by over 80000 and 100,respectively, as early as the beginning of December. This policy would cause the situation to spiral out of control, considering the scale of the response andtime to prepare. On the other hand, the burden on the current healthcare systemcaused by two-step mitigation of social distancing and 40% increased contacts in the school-age group was manageable if prepared. CONCLUSION: A compromise betweensocial distancing and school attendance policy and timely preparations for thespread of COVID-19 are required.

AB  - Although SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe illness and death, a percentage of theinfected population is asymptomatic. This, along with other factors, such asinsufficient diagnostic testing and underreporting due to self-testing,contributes to the silent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and highlights theimportance of implementing additional surveillance tools. The fecal shedding ofthe virus from infected individuals enables its detection in communitywastewater, and this has become a valuable public health tool worldwide as itallows the monitoring of the disease on a populational scale. Here, we monitored the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and its dynamic genomic changes in wastewater sampled from two metropolitan areas in Arkansas during major surges of COVID-19 cases andassessed how the viral titers in these samples related to the clinical casecounts between late April 2020 and January 2022. The levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNAwere quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) using a set of TaqMan assays targeting three different viral genes(encoding ORF1ab polyprotein, surface glycoprotein, and nucleocapsidphosphoprotein). An allele-specific RT-qPCR approach was used to screen thesamples for SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The identity and genetic diversity of the viruswere further investigated through amplicon-based RNA sequencing, and SARS-CoV-2variants of concern were detected in wastewater samples throughout the durationof this study. Our data show how changes in the virus genome can affect thesensitivity of specific RT-qPCR assays used in COVID-19 testing with the surge ofnew variants. A significant association was observed between viral titers inwastewater and recorded number of COVID-19 cases in the areas studied, exceptwhen assays failed to detect targets due to the presence of particular variants. These findings support the use of wastewater surveillance as a reliablecomplementary tool for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic variants at thecommunity level.

AB  - Introducing multi-dose formulations of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines willreduce costs and enable improved global vaccine coverage, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This work describes the development of key analyticalmethods later utilized for HPV vaccine multi-dose formulation development. First,down-selection of physicochemical methods suitable for multi-dose formulationdevelopment of four HPV (6, 11, 16, and 18) Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) adsorbed to an aluminum adjuvant (Alhydrogel(R), AH) was performed. The four monovalentAH-adsorbed HPV VLPs were then characterized using these down-selected methods.Second, stability-indicating competitive ELISA assays were developed using HPVserotype-specific neutralizing mAbs, to monitor relative antibody bindingprofiles of the four AH-adsorbed VLPs during storage. Third,concentration-dependent preservative-induced destabilization of HPV16 VLPs wasdemonstrated by addition of eight preservatives found in parenterallyadministered pharmaceuticals and vaccines, as measured by ELISA, dynamic lightscattering, and differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, preservativestability and effectiveness in the presence of vaccine components were evaluated using a combination of RP-UHPLC, a microbial growth inhibition assay, and amodified version of the European Pharmacopoeia assay (Ph. Eur. 5.1.3). Resultsare discussed in terms of analytical challenges encountered to identify anddevelop high-throughput methods that facilitate multi-dose formulationdevelopment of aluminum-adjuvanted protein-based vaccine candidates.

AB  - In recent years, cutting-edge nanotechnology research has revolutionized several facets of the food business, including food processing, packaging,transportation, preservation, and functioning. Nanotechnology has beginning toloom large in the food business as the industry's demand for biogenicnanomaterial grows. The intracellular and extracellular synthesis of metal, metaloxide, and other essential NPs has recently been explored in a variety ofmicroorganisms, including bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, yeasts, microalgae, andviruses. These microbes produce a variety extracellular material,exopolysaccharides, enzymes, and secondary metabolites which play key roles insynthesizing as well as stabilizing the nanoparticle (NPs). Furthermore, genetic engineering techniques can help them to improve their capacity to generate NPsmore efficiently. As a result, using microorganisms to manufacture NPs is unique and has a promising future. Microbial-mediated synthesis of NPs has lately beenpopular as a more environmentally friendly alternative to physical and chemicalmethods of nanomaterial synthesis, which require higher prices, more energyconsumption, and more complex reaction conditions, as well as a potentiallydangerous environmental impact. It is critical to consider regulatory measuresimplemented at all stages of the process, from production through refining,packaging, preservation, and storage, when producing bionanomaterials derivedfrom culturable microbes for efficient food preservation. The current reviewdiscusses the synthesis, mechanism of action, and possible food preservation usesof microbial mediated NPs, which can assist to minimize food deterioration fromthe inside out while also ensuring that food is safe and free of contaminants.Despite the numerous benefits, there are looming debates concerning their usagein food items, particularly regarding its aggregation in human bodies and otherrisks to the environment. Other applications and impacts of thesemicrobe-fabricated NPs in the context of future food preservation prospectsconnected with regulatory problems and potential hazards are highlighted.

AB  - To improve cross-protection of influenza vaccination, we tested conjugation ofconserved M2e epitopes to the surface of inactivated influenza virus (iPR8-M2e*).Treatment of virus with chemical cross-linker led to diminished hemagglutination activity and failure to induce hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies. ConjugatediPR8-M2e* vaccine was less protective against homologous and heterosubtypicviruses, despite the induction of virus-specific binding IgG antibodies. Inalternative approaches to enhance cross-protection, we developed a geneticallylinked chimeric protein (M2e-B stalk) vaccine with M2e of influenza A andhemagglutinin (HA) stalk of influenza B virus. Vaccination of mice withinactivated influenza A virus supplemented with M2e-B stalk effectively inducedhemagglutination inhibiting antibodies, humoral and cellular M2e immuneresponses, and enhanced heterosubtypic protection. This study demonstrates theimportance of HA functional integrity in influenza vaccine efficacy and thatsupplementation of influenza vaccines with M2e-B stalk protein could be afeasible strategy of improving cross-protection against influenza viruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a viral zoonotic disease that has been found in several countries of Asia and is responsible for high mortality andmorbidity of men and animals in rural and sub-urban endemic areas due to thevirus re-circulation among diverse hosts and vectors. The present study estimatesthe prevalence of the JE virus in the vector and animal population of the Asiancontinent using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The Cochrancollaborators' Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis[PRISMA] guidelines were used for systematic review and meta-analysis. Theheterogeneity was observed in meta-regression analysis due to several factorsincluding region, species, and different diagnostic assays used in variousstudies. Thus we did sensitivity and subgroup analysis. RESULTS: The prevalenceof the JE virus was calculated using a total sample size of 47,391. Subgroupanalysis revealed the JE virus prevalence of 39% in the Southeast Asia region,followed by East Asia with 35% and South Asia with 15% prevalence. Hence, theoverall pooled prevalence of the JE virus was 26% in the Asian continent.CONCLUSIONS: The highest proportion of infection was found in pigs amongst allanimals, reinforcing the fact that they can be used as sentinels to predictoutbreaks in humans. The findings of this study will enable researchers andpolicymakers in better understanding the disease's spatial and temporaldistribution, as well as in creating and implementing location-specific JEprevention and control measures.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whichcauses coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally. The majorreservoir for SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains controversial, with the airborneroute remaining a possible transmission vehicle for carrying the virus withinindoor environments. This study aimed to detect contamination of SARS-CoV-2 inhigh-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters within hospital isolation rooms ofconfirmed COVID-19 patients, exploring the role of nano-treatment of thesefilters with silver and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Ag/TiO2 NPs). MATERIALSAND METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of Ag-NPs/TiO2-treated HEPAfilters in the air of rooms occupied by patients with confirmed COVID-19 in auniversity teaching hospital in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia during thefirst wave of the pandemic. Ag/TiO2 NPs were designed and coated on HEPA filters to examine the filtration efficiency and antiviral ability in the presence ofaerosolized virus particles. A total of 20 viral swab samples were collected fromfive patients' rooms before and after treatment with nanoparticle-preparedsolutions into the sterile virus-transporting media. Samples were evaluated forSARS-CoV-2 with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Twosamples taken from the HEPA filter air exhaust outlets prior to nano-treatmenttested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the intensive care unit, which hasstringent aerosolization control procedures, suggesting that small virus-ladendroplets may be displaced by airflow. All air samples collected from the HEPAfilters from the rooms of patients with confirmed COVID-19 followingnano-treatment were negative. CONCLUSION: We recommend further experimentalexploration using a larger number of HEPA filters in areas withaerosol-generating procedures, along with viability studies on the HEPA filtersto facilitate decision-making in high-risk facilities regarding the replacement, storage, and disposal of HEPA filters in wards occupied by cases diagnosed with ahighly transmissible disease.

AB  - In the setting of virus infection, autophagy regulates the synthesis of type Iinterferon (IFN) via multiple mechanisms to prevent adverse overreaction.Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, the dominant transcriptional factor of typeI IFN, can be degraded via autophagy-lysosomal pathway. However, the exactregulatory mechanism is not yet well elucidated. IRF3 was targeted intoautophagosome by interacting with cargo receptors including p62, NDP52 and NBR1. The recent studies have reported the mechanism of p62 and NDP52 sequestratingIRF3. This work aims to investigate the role of NBR1 in the process of IRF3degradation. We found that blocking autophagy via ATG3/ATG7 knockout and chemicalinhibitors both resulted in the accumulation of IRF3 protein and increasedsynthesis of type I IFN, while enhancing autophagy activity led to more obviousclearance of IRF3 in HEK293T cells infected with Sendai virus (SeV). Our datasuggested that NBR1 bound both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated IRF3 throughits ubiquitin-associated domain. Meanwhile, viral infection elevated theexpression of NBR1, which sequentially formed a negative feedback loop to promoteIRF3 degradation and hence optimized the type I IFN signaling. This study expandsthe knowledge of molecular mechanisms regulating the IRF3 stability and function during viral infection.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the UVHER project is to evaluate the risk of development ofoptic nerve damage in patients with herpetic anterior uveitis (AU) prospectively followed over 2 years. Herein, we described the baseline characteristics.METHODS: This is a multicentre, prospective study. An aqueous humour tap wasperformed. Only patients with a positive PCR were included. Clinicalcharacteristics, optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters and visual field(VF) abnormalities were registered. RESULTS: 27 patients were included: 18 HerpesSimplex (HSV), one Varicella Zoster (VVZ), and 8Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Patientswith HSV-AU had severe inflammation, iris atrophy and corneal involvement. Inpatients with CMV-AU, less inflammation and medium-to-large keratic precipitates were observed. OCT showed a thinner RNFL and GCL in CMV-AU patients in comparisonto HSV patients. VF showed abnormalities in six cases. CONCLUSIONS: Patients inthe UVHER cohort showed the typical clinical manifestations of herpetic AU. InCMV patients, optic nerve damage was observed at baseline, and in HSV patients,inflammation was more severe.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe herpetic ocular infections following SARS-CoV-2vaccinations. METHODS: A retrospective study of herpetic ocular infections after BNT162b2mRNA vaccination and a literature review. RESULTS: A cohort of fivepatients: three varicella zoster virus (VZV) and two herpes simplex virus (HSV)cases, as well as 19 literature cases: 9 cases of VZV and 10 cases of HSV postBNT162b2mRNA, AZD1222, mRNA-1273, and CoronaVac vaccinations. All cases presentedwithin 28 days post vaccination. Most VZV and HSV cases (15/19) reported in theliterature presented post first vaccine dose, while in our cohort 2 VZV casespresented post second dose and both HSV cases and one VZV case post third dose.The most common presentations were HZO with ocular involvement and HSV keratitis.All eyes had complete resolution; however, one had retinal detachment and threecorneal scars. CONCLUSION: Herpetic ocular infections may develop shortly afterSARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Overall, the outcome is good.

AB  - Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) is considered an emerging threat to potato productionin the United States. PMTV is transmitted by a soil-borne protist, Spongosporasubterranean. Rapid, accurate, and sensitive detection of PMTV in leaves andtubers is an essential component in PMTV management program. A rapid test thatcan be adapted to in-field, on-site testing with minimal sample manipulationcould help in ensuring the sanitary status of the produce in situations such ascertification programs and shipping point inspections. Toward that goal, a rapid and highly sensitive recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-based test wasdeveloped for PMTV detection in potato tubers. The test combines the convenience of RPA assay with a simple sample extraction procedure, making it amenable torapid on-site diagnosis of PMTV. Furthermore, the assay was duplexed with a plantinternal control to monitor sample extraction and RPA reaction performance. Themethod described could detect as little as 10 fg of PMTV RNA transcript invarious potato tissues, the diagnostic limit of detection (LOQ) similar to thatof traditional molecular methods.

AB  - The article highlights the course of long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with a secondary immunodeficiency developed with B-cell-depleting therapy of the underlying disease. Analysis of the intrapatient virus evolution revealed aninpatient S:G75A mutation that alters the 72GTNGTKR78 motif of the S-protein,with a possible role in binding to alternative cellular receptors. Therapy with aready-made COVID-19-globulin preparation (native human immunoglobulin G (IgG)derived from the plasma of convalescent COVID-19-patients) resulted in rapidimprovement of the patient's condition, fast, and stable elimination of thevirus, and passive immunization of the patient for at least 30 days. The results suggest the use of products containing neutralizing antibodies opens newprospects for treatment algorithms for patients with persistent coronavirusinfection, as well as for passive immunization schemes for patients with apresumably reduced specific response to vaccination.

AB  - Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), a disorder caused by hypocretin/orexin (HCRT) cell loss,is associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ0602 (98%) and T cell receptor(TCR) polymorphisms. Increased CD4(+) T cell reactivity to HCRT, especiallyDQ0602-presented amidated C-terminal HCRT (HCRTNH2), has been reported, andhomology with pHA273-287 flu antigens from pandemic 2009 H1N1, an establishedtrigger of the disease, suggests molecular mimicry. In this work, we extendedDQ0602 tetramer and dextramer data to 77 cases and 44 controls, replicating ourprior finding and testing 709 TCRs in Jurkat 76 T cells for functionalactivation. We found that fewer TCRs isolated with HCRTNH2 ( approximately 11%)versus pHA273-287 or NP17-31 antigens ( approximately 50%) were activated bytheir ligand. Single-cell characterization did not reveal phenotype differencesin influenza versus HCRTNH2-reactive T cells, and analysis of TCR CDR3alphabetasequences showed TCR clustering by responses to antigens but no cross-peptideclass reactivity. Our results do not support the existence of molecular mimicrybetween HCRT and pHA273-287 or NP17-31.

PG  - e2202239119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2202239119 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophage T7 gp4 helicase has served as a model system for understandingmechanisms of hexameric replicative helicase translocation. The mechanistic basisof how nucleoside 5'-triphosphate hydrolysis and translocation of gp4 helicaseare coupled is not fully resolved. Here, we used a thermodynamically benchmarked coarse-grained protein force field, Associative memory, Water mediated, Structureand Energy Model (AWSEM), with the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) force field3SPN.2C to investigate gp4 translocation. We found that the adenosine5'-triphosphate (ATP) at the subunit interface stabilizes the subunit-subunitinteraction and inhibits subunit translocation. Hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine5'-diphosphate enables the translocation of one subunit, and new ATP binding atthe new subunit interface finalizes the subunit translocation. The LoopD2 and theN-terminal primase domain provide transient protein-protein and protein-DNAinteractions that facilitate the large-scale subunit movement. The simulations ofgp4 helicase both validate our coarse-grained protein-ssDNA force field andelucidate the molecular basis of replicative helicase translocation.

AB  - Because multipartite viruses package their genome segments in different viralparticles, they face a potentially huge cost if the entire genomic information,i.e., all genome segments, needs to be present concomitantly for the infection tofunction. Previous work with the octapartite faba bean necrotic stunt virus(FBNSV; family Nanoviridae, genus Nanovirus) showed that this issue can beresolved at the within-host level through a supracellular functioning; all viral segments do not need to be present within the same host cell but may complementeach other through intercellular trafficking of their products (protein ormessenger RNA [mRNA]). Here, we report on whether FBNSV can as well decrease the genomic integrity cost during between-host transmission. Using viable infections lacking nonessential virus segments, we show that full-genome infections can bereconstituted and function through separate acquisition and/or inoculation ofcomplementary sets of genome segments in recipient hosts. This separateacquisition/inoculation can occur either through the transmission of differentsegment sets by different individual aphid vectors or by the sequentialacquisition by the same aphid of complementary sets of segments from differenthosts. The possibility of a separate between-host transmission of differentgenome segments thus offers a way to at least partially resolve the genomicmaintenance problem faced by multipartite viruses.

PG  - 2106749
LID - 10.1080/21645515.2022.2106749 [doi]
AB  - Hadigal et al. argued the recommendation of high-dose influenza vaccine overstandard-dose formulation is not supported by comparisons ofnumbers-needed-to-vaccinate (NNV) nor aligned with the WHO mandate of improvingvaccine coverage. However, the authors' NNV calculation was inaccurate. Apreferential recommendation for vaccines preventing influenza/complications canincrease coverage. Furthermore, the impact of vaccination is a function ofefficacy/effectiveness and the vaccine-preventable fraction of disease burden;therefore Hadigal et al. should interpret the absolute risk reduction byvaccination within the context of overall disease burden. To address the threatof COVID-19 pandemic, authorities should implement concomitant influenza/COVID-19vaccination to reduce the burden of cocirculation of influenza and SARS- CoV- 2viruses and increase the coverage of proven influenza vaccines as per WHOmandate.

AB  - Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a major challenge for many youthliving with HIV (YLWH). In this prospective proof-of-concept study, we assessedthe feasibility and acceptability of conducting a study of video directlyobserved therapy (VDOT) as a method of improving medication adherence in YLWH whohad a history of poor adherence to ART. The study had four phases; phase I - VDOTdaily (4 months) using Facetime((R)); phase II - daily texting (2 months); phase III - weekly texting (3 months); phase IV - no intervention (3 months).Participants were seen in clinic on a monthly basis for assessment and laboratoryevaluation. Five of eight eligible participants were enrolled. All achievedvirologic suppression one month after enrollment. Three of five completed thestudy protocol and maintained virologic suppression through the 12-month periodof study. Participant responses to the end-of-study questionnaire indicatedsatisfaction with the intervention and thought VDOT was helpful to them.Healthcare providers thought that the intervention was effective for some youthbut was at times burdensome. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that VDOTmay be effective at improving medication adherence in previously poorly adherent YLWH and that larger studies of VDOT for such patients are both feasible andwarranted.

TI  - Health and Economic Burden of Seven Foodborne Diseases in Denmark, 2019.
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2022.0031 [doi]
AB  - We ranked seven foodborne pathogens in Denmark on the basis of their health andeconomic impact on society in 2019. We estimated burden of disease of infections with Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, norovirus, and hepatitisA virus in terms of incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALY), and economic burden in terms of direct and indirect health costs. These sevenpathogens accounted for 268,372 cases, 98 deaths, and 3121 DALYs, and led to atotal expenditure of 434 million Euro in 1 year in a country with 5.8 millioncitizens. Foodborne infections by Campylobacter, Salmonella, and norovirus causedthe most DALYs, whereas Campylobacter, and norovirus and STEC had the highercosts. A combination of disease burden and cost of illness estimates is useful toinform policymaking and establish food safety priorities at the national level.

TI  - SUMO Modification of Histone Demethylase KDM4A in Kaposi's Sarcoma-AssociatedHerpesvirus-Induced Primary Effusion Lymphoma.
PG  - e0075522
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00755-22 [doi]
AB  - Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a fatal B-cell lymphoma caused by Kaposi'ssarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. Inducing KSHV lytic replication that causes the death of host cells is an attractive treatment approach for PE;however, combination therapy inhibiting viral production is frequently needed to improve its outcomes. We have previously shown that the KSHV lytic protein K-bZIPcan SUMOylate histone lysine demethylase 4A (KDM4A) at lysine 471 (K471) and thisSUMOylation is required for virus production upon KSHV reactivation. Here, wedemonstrate that SUMOylation of KDM4A orchestrates PEL cell survival, a majorchallenge for the success of PEL treatment; and cell movement and angiogenesis,the cell functions contributing to PEL cell extravasation and dissemination.Furthermore, integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses identified interleukin-10(IL-10), an immunosuppressive cytokine, as a novel downstream target of KDM4A. Wedemonstrate that PEL-induced angiogenesis is dependent on IL-10. Moreimportantly, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis demonstrated that,at the late stage of KSHV reactivation, KDM4A determines the fates of PEL cells, as evidenced by two distinct cell populations; one with less apoptotic signaling expresses high levels of viral genes and the other is exactly opposite, whileKDM4A-K417R-expressing cells contain only the apoptotic population with lessviral gene expression. Consistently, KDM4A knockout significantly reduced cellviability and virus production in KSHV-reactivated PEL cells. Since inhibitingPEL extravasation and eradicating KSHV-infected PEL cells without increasingviral load provide a strong rationale for treating PEL, this study indicatestargeting KDM4A as a promising therapeutic option for treating PEL. IMPORTANCEPEL is an aggressive and untreatable B-cell lymphoma caused by KSHV infection.Therefore, new therapeutic approaches for PEL need to be investigated. Sincesimultaneous induction of KSHV reactivation and apoptosis can directly kill PELcells, they have been applied in the treatment of this hematologic malignancy andhave made progress. Epigenetic therapy with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitorshas been proved to treat PEL. However, the antitumor efficacies of HDACinhibitors are modest and new approaches are needed. Following our previousreport showing that the histone lysine demethylase KDM4A and its SUMOylation are required for lytic reactivation of KSHV in PEL cells, we further investigated itscellular function. Here, we found that SUMOylation of KDM4A is required for thesurvival, movement, and angiogenesis of lytic KSHV-infected PEL cells. Togetherwith our previous finding showing the importance of KDM4A SUMOylation in viralproduction, KDM4A can be a potential therapeutic target for PEL.

TI  - KSHV RTA antagonizes SMC5/6 complex-induced viral chromatin compaction byhijacking the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
PG  - e1010744
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010744 [doi]
AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a double-stranded DNA viruswith the capacity to establish life-long latent infection. During latentinfection, the viral genome persists as a circular episome that associates withcellular histones and exists as a nonintegrated minichromosome in the nucleus of infected cells. Chromatin structure and epigenetic programming are required forthe proper control of viral gene expression and stable maintenance of viral DNA. However, there is still limited knowledge regarding how the host regulates thechromatin structure and maintenance of episomal DNA. Here, we found that thecellular protein structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complex SMC5/6recognizes and associates with the KSHV genome to inhibit its replication. TheSMC5/6 complex can bind to the KSHV genome and suppress KSHV gene transcriptionby condensing the viral chromatin and creating a repressive chromatin structure. Correspondingly, KSHV employs an antagonistic strategy by utilizing the viralprotein RTA to degrade the SMC5/6 complex and antagonize the inhibitory effect ofthis complex on viral gene transcription. Interestingly, this antagonisticmechanism of RTA is evolutionarily conserved among gamma-herpesviruses. Our work suggests that the SMC5/6 complex is a new host factor that restricts KSHVreplication.

TI  - Phage endolysins are adapted to specific hosts and are evolutionarily dynamic.
PG  - e3001740
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001740 [doi]
AB  - Endolysins are produced by (bacterio)phages to rapidly degrade the bacterial cellwall and release new viral particles. Despite sharing a common function,endolysins present in phages that infect a specific bacterial species can behighly diverse and vary in types, number, and organization of their catalytic andcell wall binding domains. While much is now known about the biochemistry ofphage endolysins, far less is known about the implication of their diversity onphage-host adaptation and evolution. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we couldgenetically exchange a subset of different endolysin genes into distinctlactococcal phage genomes. Regardless of the type and biochemical properties ofthese endolysins, fitness costs associated to their genetic exchange weremarginal if both recipient and donor phages were infecting the same bacterialstrain, but gradually increased when taking place between phage that infectdifferent strains or bacterial species. From an evolutionary perspective, weobserved that endolysins could be naturally exchanged by homologous recombinationbetween phages coinfecting a same bacterial strain. Furthermore, phage endolysinscould adapt to their new phage/host environment by acquiring adaptativemutations. These observations highlight the remarkable ability of phage lyticsystems to recombine and adapt and, therefore, explain their large diversity and mosaicism. It also indicates that evolution should be considered to act onfunctional modules rather than on bacteriophages themselves. Furthermore, theextensive degree of evolvability observed for phage endolysins offers newperspectives for their engineering as antimicrobial agents.

PG  - e3001728
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001728 [doi]
AB  - Children typically experience more mild symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) when compared to adults. There is a strong body of evidence thatchildren are also less susceptible to Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with the ancestral viral isolate. However,the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) has been associated withan increased number of pediatric infections. Whether this is the result ofwidespread adult vaccination or fundamental changes in the biology of SARS-CoV-2 remain to be determined. Here, we use primary nasal epithelial cells (NECs) from children and adults, differentiated at an air-liquid interface to show that theancestral SARS-CoV-2 replicates to significantly lower titers in the NECs ofchildren compared to those of adults. This was associated with a heightenedantiviral response to SARS-CoV-2 in the NECs of children. Importantly, the Delta variant also replicated to significantly lower titers in the NECs of children.This trend was markedly less pronounced in the case of Omicron. It is alsostriking to note that, at least in terms of viral RNA, Omicron replicated better in pediatric NECs compared to both Delta and the ancestral virus. Taken together,these data show that the nasal epithelium of children supports lower infectionand replication of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, although this may be changing as thevirus evolves.

AB  - The relationship between transmission of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the amount of virus present in the proximity of a susceptible host is not understood. Here, we developed a within-host and aerosol mathematical model and used it to determine the relationship between viralkinetics in the upper respiratory track, viral kinetics in the aerosols, and new transmissions in golden hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. We determined thatinfectious virus shedding early in infection correlates with transmission events,shedding of infectious virus diminishes late in the infection, and high viral RNAlevels late in the infection are a poor indicator of transmission. We furthershowed that viral infectiousness increases in a density dependent manner withviral RNA and that their relative ratio is time-dependent. Such information isuseful for designing interventions.

PG  - e0010674
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010674 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thailand has introduced a nationwide vaccination against Japaneseencephalitis virus (JEV) into National Immunization Programme since the 1990's.To improve the understanding of immunity and susceptibility of the populationafter 28 years of a vaccination programme, we conducted a JEV seroepidemiologicalstudy in a JEV-endemic area of Thailand. METHODS: An age-stratified,population-based, seroepidemiological study was conducted in Chiang Mai,Thailand-a northern Thai province where is an endemic area of Japaneseencephalitis. Nine districts were chosen based on administrative definition:rural (n = 3); urban (n = 3); and peri-urban (n = 3). Within each district,eligible participants were randomly selected from 3 age groups: adolescents(10-20 years); adults (21-50 years); and older adults/elderly (>/=51 years) bycomputer randomization. Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50 and PRNT90)were performed to measure neutralizing antibodies to JEV. To account for thecross-reactivity of JEV and other flaviviruses, JEV seroprotection was definedaccording to age, previous history of JEV vaccination, and PRNT50/PRNT90 levelsof study participants. RESULTS: Overall, 279 adolescents, 297 adults, and 297older adults/elderly were enrolled from nine districts. Age-stratified,protocol-defined, cluster-adjusted JEV seroprotection rates were 61% (95% CI:48-73%), 43% (95% CI: 31-57%), and 52% (95% CI: 37-67%) for adolescents, adults, and older adults/elderly, respectively. Living in peri-urban districts, having a history of prior dengue virus infection, and previously receiving mousebrain-derived JEV vaccine were significantly associated with seroprotection toJEV in adolescents. Older age and male sex were associated with seroprotectionfor adults; and only male sex was the associated factor for older adults/elderly (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of population living in a JEV-endemic area demonstrated seroprotection to JEV. Ongoing nationwide surveillance on JEVseropepidemiology is an important strategy to understand the evolvingpopulation-level immunity to JEV, and to help formulating the appropriaterecommendations on JE immunization.

AB  - In spite of the availability of vaccine, the health burden associated with theCOVID-19 pandemic continues to increase. An estimated 5 million people have died with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of evolution and genomic diversity canprovide sufficient information to reduce the health burden of the pandemic. This study focused to conduct worldwide genomic surveillance. About 7.6 milliongenomic data were analyzed during 2019 to 2022. Multiple sequence alignment wasconducted by using maximum likelihood method. Clade GK (52%) was the mostpredominant followed by GRY (12%), GRA (11%), GR (8%), GH (7%), G (6%), GV (3%), and O (1%), respectively. VOC Delta (66%) was the most prevalent variant followedby VOC Alpha (18%), VOC Omicron (13%), VOC Gamma (2%) and VOC Beta (1%),respectively. The frequency of point mutations including E484K, N501Y, N439K, andL452R at spike protein has increased 10%-92%. Evolutionary rate of the variantswas 23.7 substitution per site per year. Substitution mutations E484K and N501Yhad significant correlation with cases (r = .45, r = .23), fatalities (r = .15, r= .44) and growth rate R0 (r = .28, r = .54). This study will help to understand the genomic diversity, evolution and the impact of the variants on the outcome ofthe COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Inactivation rate of African swine fever virus by a formaldehyde-based product.
LID - skac248 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jas/skac248 [doi]
AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is an important transboundary animal disease with ahigh mortality rate. The high African swine fever virus (ASFV) titers in theexcretion of infected wild boar possibly contaminate the feed ingredient. Oncecontaminated, it could support persistent residual titer of the ASFV. Thechemical inactivation of imported feed ingredient is a precautionary riskmanagement measure to restrict the import risk of ASFV through internationaltrade. The log ASFV titers were linearly reduced as a function of theinactivation time after exposure to 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2% formaldehyde-based product (FBP). A four-log reduction of ASFV titer was achieved after exposure to 0.2% FBP and 0.03-0.1% FBP for 30-min and 60-min inactivation time, respectively.The decimal reduction time or D value is defined as the time required toinactivate the virus titer by 1 log. The ASFV inactivation rate from theindependent experiment of FBP concentration was converted to a D value. Theobserved mean D0.2%, D0.1%, D0.05%, and D0.03% of FBP were 13.4, 44.9, 45.0, and 45.3 min per log reduction of ASFV, respectively. The interpretation of D0.2% of FBP is that the ASFV titer is inactivated by 1 log after being exposed to 0.2%FBP for every 13.4 min. A more effective chemical has a lower D value because of a shorter inactivation time required to achieve the same 1-log reduction.Additionally, the hypothetical inactivation time by any chemical additive isscenario-specific and is calculated by the product of D value (at a certainconcentration) and log titers of residual ASFV. This study introduces the conceptand application of D value to compare the virucidal activity of chemicals and to determine the hypothetical inactivation time of chemicals depending on thechemical concentration including the virus titer in the feed.

TI  - Bile acid restrained T cell activation explains cholestasis aggravated hepatitis B virus infection.
PG  - e22468
LID - 10.1096/fj.202200332R [doi]
AB  - Cholestasis is a common complication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection,characterized by increased intrahepatic and plasma bile acid levels. Cholestasis was found negatively associated with hepatitis outcome, however, the exactmechanism by which cholestasis impacts anti-viral immunity and impedes HBVclearance remains elusive. Here, we found that cholestatic mice are featured withdysfunctional T cells response, as indicated by decreased sub-population ofCD25(+) /CD69(+) CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, while CTLA-4(+) CD4(+) and CD8(+)subsets were increased. Mechanistically, bile acids disrupt intracellular calciumhomeostasis via inhibiting mitochondria calcium uptake and elevating cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration, leading to STIM1 and ORAI1 decoupling and impairedstore-operated Ca(2+) entry which is essential for NFAT signaling and T cellsactivation. Moreover, in a transgenic mouse model of HBV infection, we confirmed that cholestasis compromised both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells activation resulting in poor viral clearance. Collectively, our results suggest that bile acids playpivotal roles in anti-HBV infection via controlling T cells activation andmetabolism and that targeting the regulation of bile acids may be a therapeuticstrategy for host-virus defense.

PG  - 925-932
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000002425 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-coronavirus disease (post-COVID) symptoms arise mostly fromimpaired function of respiratory tract although in many patients, the dysfunctionof gastrointestinal tract and liver among other organ systems may persist.METHODS: Primary data collection was based on a short gastrointestinal symptomquestionnaire at the initial screening. A brief telephone survey within thepatient and control group was performed 5-8 months after the initial screening. Rver. 4.0.5 and imbalanced RandomForest (RF) machine-learning algorithm were used for data explorations and analyses. RESULTS: A total of 590 patients wereincluded in the study. The general presence of gastrointestinal symptoms 208.2days (153-230 days) after the initial acute severe acute respiratory syndromecorona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was 19% in patients withmoderate-to-serious course of the disease and 7.3% in patients with mild coursecompared with 3.0% in SARS-CoV-2 negative controls (P < 0.001). Diarrhea andabdominal pain are the most prevalent post-COVID gastrointestinal symptoms. RFmachine-learning algorithm identified acute diarrhea and antibioticsadministration as the strongest predictors for gastrointestinal sequelae witharea under curve of 0.68. Variable importance for acute diarrhea is 0.066 and0.058 for antibiotics administration. CONCLUSION: The presence ofgastrointestinal sequelae 7 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection issignificantly higher in patients with moderate-to-severe course of the acuteCOVID-19 compared with asymptomatic patients or those with mild course of thedisease. The most prevalent post-COVID gastrointestinal symptoms are diarrhea andabdominal pain. The strongest predictors for persistence of these symptoms areantibiotics administration and acute diarrhea during the initial infection.

TI  - Persistent Correlation in Cellular Noise Determines Longevity of ViralInfections.
PG  - 7252-7260
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01875 [doi]
AB  - The slowly decaying viral dynamics, even after 2-3 weeks from diagnosis, is oneof the characteristics of COVID-19 infection that is still unexplored intheoretical and experimental studies. This long-lived characteristic of viralinfections in the framework of inherent variations or noise present at thecellular level is often overlooked. Therefore, in this work, we aim to understandthe effect of these variations by proposing a stochastic non-Markovian model thatnot only captures the coupled dynamics between the immune cells and the virus butalso enables the study of the effect of fluctuations. Numerical simulations ofour model reveal that the long-range temporal correlations in fluctuationsdictate the long-lived dynamics of a viral infection and, in turn, also affectthe rates of immune response. Furthermore, predictions of our model system are inagreement with the experimental viral load data of COVID-19 patients from variouscountries.

Variable importance for acute diarrhea is 0.066 and0.058 for antibiotics administration. CONCLUSION: The presence ofgastrointestinal sequelae 7 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection issignificantly higher in patients with moderate-to-severe course of the acuteCOVID-19 compared with asymptomatic patients or those with mild course of thedisease. The most prevalent post-COVID gastrointestinal symptoms are diarrhea andabdominal pain. The strongest predictors for persistence of these symptoms areantibiotics administration and acute diarrhea during the initial infection.

TI  - Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) Reactivation in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Brief Narrative Review.
LID - 10.1007/s40121-022-00674-0 [doi]
AB  - Systemic or pulmonary reactivations of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) have beenreported in critically ill patients with COVID-19, posing a dilemma forclinicians in terms of their diagnostic and clinical relevance. Prevalence ofHSV-1 reactivation may be as high as > 40% in this population, but with largeheterogeneity across studies, likely reflecting the different samples and/orcut-offs for defining reactivation. There is frequently agreement on the clinicalsignificance of HSV-1 reactivation in the presence of severe manifestationsclearly attributable to the virus. However, the clinical implications of HSV-1reactivations in the absence of manifest signs and symptoms remain controversial.Our review aims at providing immunological background and at reviewing clinicalfindings on HSV-1 reactivations in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05550-3 [doi]
AB  - Genetic relationships between rabies virus (RABV) isolates recovered from dogs,jackals, and cattle in Georgia and their closest relatives were investigated bycomparing their nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences. Multiple isolates from dogs andcattle were found to share identical N gene sequences, indicating a risk ofdog-to-cattle rabies transmission in Georgia. Exhibiting population-selectivesweeps, expansion, and genetic recombination, evolutionary analysis of GeorgianRABV isolates (all belonging to the cosmopolitan clade) and isolates from Russia,Turkey, and elsewhere provided further evidence for coinfections with differentrabies virus strains and transborder transmission.

TI  - Bovine coronavirus nucleocapsid suppresses IFN-beta production by inhibitingRIG-I-like receptors pathway in host cells.
PG  - 536
LID - 10.1007/s00203-022-03149-5 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to explore if bovine coronavirus nucleocapsid (BCoV N)impacts IFN-beta production in the host cells and to reveal further molecularmechanism of BCoV pathogenesis. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells weretransiently transfected with pMyc-BCoV-N recombinant plasmids, then infected withthe vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Expression levels of beta interferon(IFN-beta) mRNA were detected using RT-qPCR. The results showed that BCoV N gene was 1347 bp that was consistent with the expected size. pMyc-BCoV-N recombinantprotein was 1347 bp which was successfully transcribed and overexpressed in HEK293 T cells. BCoV-N recombinant protein inhibited dose-dependently VSV-inducedIFN-beta production (p < 0.01). MDA5, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3 could promotetranscription levels of IFN-beta mRNA. But, BCoV-N protein demoted IFN-betatranscription levels induced by MDA5, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3. Furthermore,expression levels of MDA5, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3 mRNAs were reduced in RIG-I-likereceptor (RLR) pathway. In conclusion, BCoV-N reduced IFN-beta levels inRIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway in HEK 293 T cells which were induced by MDA5, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3(5D). BCoV-N protein inhibited IFN-beta production andactivation of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) signal pathway. Our findingsdemonstrated BCoV N protein is an IFN-beta antagonist through inhibition of MDA5,MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3(5D) in RLRs pathway, also revealed a new mechanism of BCoV N protein to evade host innate immune response by inhibiting type I IFN production,which is beneficial to developing novel prevention strategy for BCoV disease inthe animals and humans.

TI  - Peritoneal dialysis in the era of COVID-19: experience of a Tunisian center.
LID - 10.1007/s40620-022-01396-9 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the health landscape by hampering themanagement of patients with chronic diseases. Providing optimal healthcare hasbecome a critical issue, especially for patients with end-stage renal disease(ESRD) receiving in-center dialysis. Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) has the advantageof being a home-based therapy. Several papers about COVID-19 in the chronickidney disease (CKD) population have been published, but few studies focused onthe PD population, with limited case series. In this paper, we share our strategyfor managing PD patients during the pandemic and describe the characteristics of 24 episodes of COVID-19 that occurred in our PD patients. Also, we report theimpact of the pandemic on different outcomes and discuss the challenges of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the time of COVID-19 and the advantages of PD.During the period from December 2019 to September 2021, 127 patients received PD in our center. Among them, we recorded 24 episodes of COVID-19 that occurred in20 patients, corresponding to an incidence of 8.4 per 1000 patient-months. Noneof the 20 patients with COVID-19 were vaccinated and there was a significant malegender predominance in the COVID-19 group compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Theprevalence of diabetic nephropathy and primary glomerulonephritis were alsosignificantly higher in the COVID-19 group. The revealing symptoms were asthenia,dry cough, and the deterioration of general conditions in 100%, 75%, and 63% ofthe patients, respectively. A biological inflammatory syndrome was found in 30%of the patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan, performed in 5 patients,showed features of COVID pneumonia with an average extent of damage of 55%. Therate of patients starting PD during the study period was comparable to thatbefore the pandemic. Furthermore, we did not find a significant differencebetween the infected and the non-infected groups regarding the incidence ofperitonitis, PD technique failure, and mortality (6.1 [0-1.46] vs 3.9 [0.15-0.64]deaths per 1000 patient-months. COVID-19 does not seem to have influenced theoutcomes of our patients treated with PD even before the launch of massimmunization in our country. Thus, PD can be a great option for RRT in the era ofthe COVID-19 pandemic since many issues could be managed remotely to avoidregular hospital visits and contribute to maintaining social distancing, which isthe cornerstone of breaking the chain of transmission of the novel virus.

Here, we developed a DNAvaccine using the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus G (VG) gene and chemokine(C-C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19)a.2 regulated by the CMV promoter as the molecularadjuvant. After transfection of the prepared plasmid (pVG + CCL19) intoepithelioma papulosum cyprini cells, mRNA expression was confirmed throughquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The vaccine was intramuscularlyinjected into zebrafish (Danio rerio), and 28 days after immunization, viralhemorrhagic septicemia virus (10(5) TCID50/10 microl/fish) was intraperitoneally injected. A survival rate of 68% was observed in the pVG + CCL19 group but thiswas not significantly different from the survival rate of fish treated with pVGalone, that is, without the adjuvant. However, the expression of interferon- and cytokine-related genes in the spleen and kidney tissues of zebrafish wassignificantly increased (p < 0.05) on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after immunization.Thus, CCL19a.2 induced an initial immune response as a molecular adjuvant, which may provide initial protection against virus infection before vaccination-inducedantibody formation. This study provides insights on the functions of CCL19a.2adjuvant in DNA vaccines.

TI  - Implementing HIV Prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review ofInterventions Targeting Systems, Communities, and Individuals.
LID - 10.1007/s10461-022-03751-0 [doi]
AB  - HIV remains a threat to global public health, disproportionately affectingcountries across Sub-Saharan Africa. Although treatment and access to care haveimproved, prevention remains critical to ending new HIV infections by 2030. Avariety of prevention strategies exist, yet their effectiveness is difficult tomeasure and variable due to the nature of the interventions and vulnerability of the intervention during implementation. This systematic review of 51 studiessynthesizes data on the implementation and evaluation of evidence-based HIVprevention interventions across Sub-Saharan Africa. Studies were included if theyoccurred between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2019, inclusive in Sub-SaharanAfrica, were written in English, implemented an HIV prevention intervention inthe field, and had reportable results. Using a modified social-ecological modelfor HIV prevention, we divided studies into three categories: interventionstargeting health systems (n = 16), communities (n = 8), and individuals (n = 27).Across all categories, the data emphasized preventing mother-to-childtransmission (PMTCT), medical interventions, and psychosocial interventions. The most successful programs bundled several interventions that were integrated into the health system. There is a notable lack of interventions targeting keypopulations and there are significant rates of loss to follow up (LTFU) acrossmany studies. This review provides insight into the prioritization ofevidence-based HIV prevention interventions across Sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a global pandemic and caused hugehealthy and economic losses. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially contacttracing and social distance restrictions, play a vital role in the control ofCOVID-19. Understanding the spatial impact is essential for designing such acontrol policy. Based on epidemic data of the confirmed cases after the Wuhanlockdown, we calculate the invasive reproduction numbers of COVID-19 in thedifferent regions of China. Statistical analysis indicates a significant positivecorrelation between the reproduction numbers and the population input sizes from Wuhan, which indicates that the large-scale population movement contributed a lotto the geographic spread of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, there is a significantpositive correlation between reproduction numbers and local population densities,which shows that the higher population density intensifies the spread of disease.Considering that in the early stage, there were sequential imported cases thataffected the estimation of reproduction numbers, we classify the imported casesand local cases through the information of epidemiological data and calculate thenet invasive reproduction number to quantify the local spread of the epidemic.The results are applied to the design of border control policy on the basis ofvaccination coverage.

TI  - Exercise effect on symptom severity, morbidity and mortality in viral infections:a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 133-140
AB  - There is a knowledge gap regarding the consequences of exercise during acuteinfections in humans and contradictory findings in animal studies, compromisingpublic health advice on the potential benefits of physical activity for immunity.Here, we carried out a meta-analysis of studies of the effects of moderateexercise (ME) and exercise until fatigue (EF) on symptom severity, morbidity and mortality during viral infection in animal models. The systematic review onPubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane and EBSCOhost (CINAHL and SPORT Discus) identified 8 controlled studies, with 15 subgroups within them. Thestudies exposed the animals (mice [7 studies] and monkeys [1 study]) to exercise immediately before or after viral inoculation (HSV-1, H1N1 influenza and B.K.virus) with follow-up for 21 days. ME significantly reduced morbidity (OR 0.43[0.19; 0.98], P = 0.04) with no change for symptom severity (SMD -3.37 [-9.01;2.28], P = 0.24) or mortality (OR 0.48 [0.08;3.03], P = 0.43). In contrast, EFgave a trend towards increased symptom severity (SMD 0.96 [-0.06; 1.98], P =0.07) and mortality (OR 1.47 [0.96;2.28], P =0.08) with no change in morbidity(OR 1.22 [0.60;2.5], P = 0.58). We conclude that in animals moderate exerciseduring infection is advantageous, whilst exercise until fatigue should beavoided. Further research is required to determine if moderate exercise may also be beneficial in humans during infection.

LID - ciac629 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explore SARS-CoV-2 antibody lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)performance under field conditions compared to laboratory-basedelectrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and live virus neutralisation.METHODS: In July 2021, 3758 participants performed, at home, a self-administered Fortress LFIA on finger-prick blood, reported and submitted a photograph of theresult, and provided a self-collected capillary blood sample for assessment ofIgG antibodies using the Roche Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA. We compared the self-reported LFIA result to the quantitative ECLIA and checked the reading ofthe LFIA result with an automated image analysis (ALFA). In a subsample of 250participants, we compared the results to live virus neutralisation. RESULTS:Almost all participants (3593/3758, 95.6%) had been vaccinated or reported prior infection. Overall, 2777/3758 (73.9%) were positive on self-reported LFIA,2811/3457 (81.3%) positive by LFIA when ALFA-reported, and 3622/3758 (96.4%)positive on ECLIA (using the manufacturer reference standard threshold forpositivity of 0.8 U ml-1). Live virus neutralisation was detected in 169 of 250randomly selected samples (67.6%); 133/169 were positive with self-reported LFIA (sensitivity 78.7%; 95% CI 71.8, 84.6), 142/155 (91.6%; 86.1, 95.5) with ALFA,and 169 (100%; 97.8, 100.0) with ECLIA. There were 81 samples with no detectable virus neutralisation; 47/81 were negative with self-reported LFIA (specificity58.0%; 95% CI 46.5, 68.9), 34/75 (45.3%; 33.8, 57.3) with ALFA, and 0/81 (0%;0.0, 4.5) with ECLIA. CONCLUSIONS: Self-administered LFIA is less sensitive than a quantitative antibody test, but the positivity in LFIA correlates better thanthe quantitative ECLIA with virus neutralisation.

TI  - Platform for Active Vaccine Formulation Using a Two-Mode Enhancement Mechanism ofEpitope Presentation by Pickering Emulsion.
LID - 10.1021/acsabm.2c00410 [doi]
AB  - The efficiency of epitope-based vaccination (subunit vaccines) is tightlycorrelated with heterogeneity and the high density of epitope presentation, whichmaximizes the potential antigenic determinants. Here, we developed a two-modeplatform for intensifying the epitope presentation of subunit vaccines. Thetwo-mode epitope presentation enhancement includes a covalent attachment of high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-S1 peptide epitope to the surface ofvirus-like-particles (VLPs) and the subsequent assembly of VLP/epitope conjugateson the oil droplet surface at an oil/water interface of an emulsion as Pickering stabilizers. The resultant emulsions were stable for weeks in ambient conditions,and our platform was challenged using the epitope of the SARS-CoV-2-S1 peptidethat served as a model epitope in this study. In vivo assays showed that thealphaSARS-CoV-2-S1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers of the studied mouse antisera,developed against the SARS-CoV-2-S1 peptide under different epitope preparationconditions, showed an order of magnitude higher IgG titers in the studiedVLP-based emulsions than epitopes dissolved in water and epitopes administeredwith an adjuvant, thereby confirming the efficacy of the formulation. ThisVLP-based Pickering emulsion platform is a fully synthetic approach that can bereadily applied for vaccine development to a wide range of pathogens.

LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, noroviruses cause infections year-round but have recognizedwinter seasonality in the northern hemisphere and yearly variations in incidence.With candidate norovirus vaccines in development, understanding temporal andgeographic trends in norovirus disease is important to inform potentialvaccination strategies and evaluate vaccine impact. METHODS: We analyzed datafrom the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) and CaliciNet on single-state norovirus outbreaks that occurred from August 2009-July 2019 in the contiguousUnited States. We defined norovirus season onset and offset as the weeks by which10% and 90% of norovirus outbreaks in a surveillance year occurred, respectively,and duration as the difference in weeks between onset and offset. We comparednorovirus seasons across surveillance years and geographic regions. RESULTS:During August 2009-July 2019, 24,995 single-state norovirus outbreaks werereported to NORS and/or CaliciNet. Nationally, median norovirus season durationwas 24 weeks, with onset occurring between October-December and offset occurring between April-May. Across all years combined, we observed a west-to-east trend inseasonality, with the earliest onset (October) and latest offset (May) occurring in western regions and the latest onset (December) and earliest offset (April)occurring in northeastern regions. CONCLUSIONS: Timing and duration of the USnorovirus season varied annually, but generally occurred during October-May.Norovirus wintertime seasonality was less distinct in western regions and wasprogressively more pronounced moving east. Further understanding the drivers ofspatiotemporal dynamics of norovirus could provide insights into factorspromoting virus transmission and help guide future interventions.

TI  - Conformational Changes in Herpes Simplex Virus Glycoprotein C.
PG  - e0016322
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00163-22 [doi]
AB  - Low endosomal pH facilitates herpesvirus entry in a cell-specific manner. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) causes significant morbidity and death in humansworldwide. HSV-1 enters cells by low-pH and neutral-pH pathways. Low-pH-inducedconformational changes in the HSV envelope glycoprotein B (gB) may mediatemembrane fusion during viral entry. HSV-1 gC, a 511-amino acid, type I integralmembrane glycoprotein, mediates HSV-1 attachment to host cell surfaceglycosaminoglycans, but this interaction is not essential for viral entry. Wepreviously demonstrated that gC regulates low-pH viral entry independent of itsknown role in cell attachment. Low-pH-triggered conformational changes in gBoccur at a lower pH when gC is absent, suggesting that gC positively regulates gBconformational changes. Here, we demonstrate that mildly acidic pH triggersconformational changes in gC itself. Low-pH treatment of virions inducedantigenic changes in distinct gC epitopes, and those changes were reversible. Oneof these gC epitopes is recognized by a monoclonal antibody that binds to alinear sequence that includes residues within gC amino acids 33 to 123. Thisantibody inhibited low-pH entry of HSV, suggesting that its gC N-terminal epitopeis particularly important. We propose that gC plays a critical role in HSV entry through a low-pH endocytosis pathway, which is a major entry route in humanepithelial cells. IMPORTANCE Herpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that causelifelong latent infections and are characterized by multiple entry pathways. The HSV envelope gC regulates HSV entry by a low-pH entry route. The fusion proteingB undergoes pH-triggered conformational changes that are facilitated by gC.Here, we report that gC itself undergoes a conformational change at low pH. Amonoclonal antibody to gC that binds to a region that undergoes pH-inducedchanges also selectively inhibits HSV low-pH entry, corroborating the importance of gC in the low-pH entry pathway. This study illustrates the complex role ofendosomal pH during HSV entry and provides novel insights into the functions ofgC.

TI  - Riplet Binds the Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) and Augments ZAP-MediatedRestriction of HIV-1.
PG  - e0052622
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00526-22 [doi]
AB  - The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)with potent intrinsic antiviral activity. ZAP inhibits the replication ofretroviruses, including murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV-1, as well asalphaviruses, filoviruses, and hepatitis B virus, and also the retrotranspositionof LINE-1 and Alu retroelements. ZAP operates posttranscriptionally to reduce thelevels of viral transcripts available for translation in the cytoplasm, although additional functions might be involved. Recent studies have shown that ZAPpreferentially binds viral mRNAs containing clusters of CpG dinucleotides via itsfour CCCH-type zinc fingers. ZAP lacks enzymatic activity and utilizes othercellular proteins to suppress viral replication. Tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) andthe nuclease KHNYN have been identified as ZAP cofactors. In this study, weidentify Riplet, a protein known to play a central role in the activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), as a novel ZAP cofactor. Overexpressionof Riplet acts to strongly augment ZAP's antiviral activity. Riplet is an E3ubiquitin ligase containing three domains, an N-terminal RING finger domain, acentral coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal P/SPRY domain. We show that Ripletinteracts with ZAP via its P/SPRY domain and that the ubiquitin ligase activityof Riplet is not required to stimulate ZAP-mediated virus inhibition. Moreover,we show that Riplet interacts with TRIM25, suggesting that both Riplet and TRIM25may operate as a complex to augment ZAP activity. IMPORTANCE The ZAP is a potent restriction factor inhibiting replication of many RNA viruses by binding directlyto viral RNAs and targeting them for degradation. We here identify RIPLET as acofactor that stimulates ZAP activity. The finding connects ZAP to other innateimmunity pathways and suggests oligomerization as a common theme in sensingpathogenic RNAs.

TI  - Evaluating the Biological Role of Lassa Viral Z Protein-Mediated RIG-I InhibitionUsing a Replication-Competent Trisegmented Pichinde Virus System in an Inducible RIG-IN Expression Cell Line.
PG  - e0075422
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00754-22 [doi]
AB  - Lassa virus (LASV) is a mammarenavirus that can cause lethal Lassa fever disease with no FDA-approved vaccine and limited treatment options. Fatal LASV infectionsare associated with innate immune suppression. We have previously shown that the small matrix Z protein of LASV, but not of a nonpathogenic arenavirus Pichindevirus (PICV), can inhibit the cellular RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), but itsbiological significance has not been evaluated in an infectious virus due to the multiple essential functions of the Z protein required for the viral life cycle. In this study, we developed a stable HeLa cell line (HeLa-iRIGN) that could berapidly and robustly induced by doxycycline (Dox) treatment to express RIG-IN-terminal effector, with concomitant production of type I interferons (IFN-Is). We also generated recombinant tri-segmented PICVs, rP18tri-LZ, and rP18tri-PZ,which encode LASV Z and PICV Z, respectively, as an extra mScarlet fusion proteinthat is nonessential for the viral life cycle. Upon infection, rP18tri-LZconsistently expressed viral genes at a higher level than rP18tri-PZ. rP18tri-LZ also showed a higher level of a viral infection than rP18tri-PZ did in HeLa-iRIGNcells, especially upon Dox induction. The heterologous Z gene did not alter viralgrowth in Vero and A549 cells by growth curve analysis, while LASV Z stronglyincreased and prolonged viral gene expression, especially in IFN-competent A549cells. Our study provides important insights into the biological role of LASVZ-mediated RIG-I inhibition and implicates LASV Z as a potential virulencefactor. IMPORTANCE Lassa virus (LASV) can cause lethal hemorrhagic fever disease in humans but other arenaviruses, such as Pichinde virus (PICV), do not causeobvious disease. We have previously shown that the Z protein of LASV but not ofPICV can inhibit RIG-I, a cytosolic innate immune receptor. In this study, wedeveloped a stable HeLa cell line that can be induced to express the RIG-IN-terminal effector domain, which allows for timely control of RIG-I activation. We also generated recombinant PICVs encoding LASV Z or PICV Z as an extra genethat is nonessential for the viral life cycle. Compared to PICV Z, LASV Z couldincrease viral gene expression and viral infection in an infectious arenavirussystem, especially when RIG-I signaling is activated. Our study presented aconvenient cell system to characterize RIG-I signaling and its antagonists andrevealed LASV Z as a possible virulence factor and a potential antiviral target.

TI  - Negative Regulatory Role of the Spring Viremia of Carp Virus Matrix Protein inthe Host Interferon Response by Targeting the MAVS/TRAF3 Signaling Axis.
PG  - e0079122
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00791-22 [doi]
AB  - Spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) is a severe infectious pathogen that causeshigh rates of mortality in cyprinids and other fish species. Despite numerousinvestigations of SVCV infection, the underlying molecular mechanisms remainpoorly understood. In this study, we found that the SVCV matrix protein (SVCV-M) played an inhibitory role in the host interferon (IFN) response by targeting the MAVS/TRAF3 signaling axis, thereby uncovering a previously unrecognized mechanismof SVCV escape from host innate antiviral immunity. Mechanistically, SVCV-M waslocated at the mitochondria independent of MAVS, which allowed SVCV-M to build anarena for competition with the MAVS platform. A microscale thermophoresis assayshowed that SVCV-M had a high affinity for TRAF3, as indicated by a lowerequilibrium dissociation constant (KD) value than that of MAVS with TRAF3.Therefore, the association of MAVS with TRAF3 was competitively impaired bySVCV-M in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, SVCV-M showed a potent ability toinhibit the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3. This inhibition wasaccompanied by the impairment of the IFN response, as shown by the marked declinein IFN-phi1-promoter (pro) luciferase reporter activity. By constructingtruncated TRAF3 and SVCV-M proteins, the RING finger, zinc finger, andcoiled-coil domains of TRAF3 and the hydrophobic-pocket-like structure formed by the alpha2-, alpha3-, and alpha4-helices of SVCV-M may be the major target andantagonistic modules responsible for the protein-protein interaction between the TRAF3 and SVCV-M proteins. These findings highlighted the intervention of SVCV-M in host innate immunity, thereby providing new insights into the extensiveparticipation of viral matrix proteins in multiple biological activities.IMPORTANCE The matrix protein of SVCV (SVCV-M) is an indispensable structuralelement for nucleocapsid condensation and virion formation during viralmorphogenesis, and it connects the core nucleocapsid particle to the outermembrane within the mature virus. Previous studies have emphasized thearchitectural role of SVCV-M in viral construction; however, the potentialnonstructural functions of SVCV-M in viral replication and virus-hostinteractions remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified theinhibitory role of the SVCV-M protein in host IFN production by competitivelyrecruiting TRAF3 from the MAVS signaling complex and impairing TRAF3 activationvia inhibition of K63-linked polyubiquitination. This finding provided newinsights into the regulatory role of SVCV-M in host innate immunity, whichhighlighted the broader functionality of rhabdovirus matrix protein apart frombeing a structural protein. This study also revealed a previously unrecognizedmechanism underlying SVCV immune evasion by inhibiting the IFN response bytargeting the MAVS/TRAF3 signaling axis.

TI  - Increased Prevalence of Lassa Fever Virus-Positive Rodents and Diversity ofInfected Species Found during Human Lassa Fever Epidemics in Nigeria.
PG  - e0036622
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00366-22 [doi]
AB  - The dynamics of Lassa virus (LASV) infections in rodent reservoirs and theirendemic human caseloads remain poorly understood. During the endemic period,human infections are believed to be associated with the seasonal migration ofMastomys natalensis, thought to be the primary reservoir that triggers multiplespillovers of LASV to humans. It has become imperative to improve LASV diagnosis in rodents while updating their prevalence in two regions of Lassa feverendemicity in Nigeria. Rodents (total, 942) were trapped in Ondo (531) and Ebonyi(411) states between October 2018 and April 2020 for detection of LASV usingvarious tissues. Overall, the LASV prevalence was 53.6%. The outbreak areasampled in Ondo had three and two times higher capture success and LASVprevalence, respectively, than Ebonyi State. This correlated with the highernumber of annual cases of Lassa fever (LF) in Ondo State versus Ebonyi State. Allrodent genera (Mastomys, Rattus, Crocidura, Mus, and Tatera) captured in bothstates showed slightly variable LASV positivity, with Rattus spp. being the most predominantly infected (77.3%) rodents in Ondo State versus Mastomys spp. (41.6%)in Ebonyi State. The tissues with the highest LASV positivity were the kidneys,spleen, and testes. The finding of a relatively high LASV prevalence in all ofthe rodent genera captured highlights the complex interspecies transmissiondynamics of LASV infections in the reservoirs and their potential associationwith increased environmental contact, as well as the risk of zoonotic spilloverin these communities, which have the highest prevalence of Lassa fever inNigeria. IMPORTANCE Our findings show the highest LASV positivity in smallrodents ever recorded and the first direct detection of LASV in Tatera spp. Ourfindings also indicate the abundance of LASV-infected small rodents in houses,with probable interspecies transmission through vertical and horizontal coitusroutes. Consequently, we suggest that the abundance of different reservoirspecies for LASV may fuel the epizootic outbreaks of LF in affected humancommunities. The high prevalence of LASV with the diversity of affected rodentshas direct implications for our understanding of the transmission risk,mitigation, and ultimately, the prevention of LF in humans. Optimal tissues forLASV detection in rodents are also presented.

LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01698-22 [doi]
AB  - Diarrhea caused by early-weaning-induced stress can increase mortality rates and reduce growth performance of piglets, seriously harming the livestock industry.To date, studies on the gut microbiome of early-weaned piglets have focusedalmost exclusively on bacteria, while studies on their gut virome are extremelylacking. Here, we used metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing combinedwith bioinformatic analysis techniques to preliminarily characterize theintestinal virome of early-weaned piglets at different biological classification levels. The alpha diversity of enteroviruses was generally elevated inearly-weaned piglets with diarrhea, compared to healthy piglets, whereas the two groups of piglets showed no significant difference in beta diversity. Inaddition, the species compositions of the gut virome were similar between healthypiglets and piglets with diarrhea, while their respective dominant species weresomewhat different. We also identified 58 differential DNA viruses and 16differential RNA viruses between the two groups of piglets at all biologicaltaxonomic levels. Of these, 1 (family Dhakavirus) and 6 (phylum Artverviricota,class Revtraviricetes, order Ortervirales, family Retroviridae, genusGammaretrovirus, and species Kirsten murine sarcoma virus) specific virusesdisappeared from the intestines of healthy piglets and piglets with diarrhea,respectively. Moreover, we found that some DNA and RNA viruses formed strongcorrelations among themselves or between them. IMPORTANCE This studysystematically reveals the biological diversity, structure, and composition ofintestinal DNA and RNA virus profiles in early-weaned piglets. Furthermore,characteristics of differences in gut viromes between early-weaned healthypiglets and piglets with diarrhea were also elucidated. Importantly, somepotential biomarkers for early-weaned piglets with diarrhea were identified.These findings fill a gap for the early-weaned piglet gut virome and lay thefoundation for the development of strategies to target enteroviruses for theprevention and treatment of early-weaning-induced piglet diarrhea.

TI  - Microalgae and Bacteria Interaction-Evidence for Division of Diligence in theAlga Microbiota.
PG  - e0063322
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00633-22 [doi]
AB  - Microalgae are one of the most dominant forms of life on earth that is tightlyassociated with a distinct and specialized microbiota. We have previously shownthat the microbiota of Scenedesmus quadricauda harbors less than 10 distinctmicrobial species. Here, we provide evidence that dominant species are affiliatedwith the genera of Variovorax, Porphyrobacter, and Dyadobacter. Experimental and transcriptome-based evidence implies that within this multispecies interaction,Dyadobacter is a key to alga growth and fitness and is highly adapted to live in the phycosphere. While presumably under light conditions the alga provides theenergy source to the bacteria, Dyadobacter produces and releases mainly a largevariety of polysaccharides modifying enzymes. This is coherent with high-levelexpression of the T9SS in alga cocultures. The transcriptome data further implythat quorum-quenching proteins (QQ) and biosynthesis of vitamins B1, B2, B5, B6, and B9 are expressed by Dyadobacter at high levels in comparison to Variovoraxand Porphyrobacter. Notably, Dyadobacter produces a significant number ofleucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins and enzymes involved in bacterial reactiveoxygen species (ROS) tolerance. Complementary to this, Variovorax expresses thegenes of the biosynthesis of vitamins B2, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12, andPorphyrobacter is specialized in the production of vitamins B2 and B6. Thus, the shared currency between partners are vitamins, microalgae growth-promotingsubstances, and dissolved carbon. This work significantly enlarges our knowledge on alga-bacteria interaction and demonstrates physiological investigations ofmicroalgae and associated bacteria, using microscopy observations, photosyntheticactivity measurements, and flow cytometry. IMPORTANCE The current study gives adetailed insight into mutualistic collaboration of microalgae and bacteria,including the involvement of competitive interplay between bacteria. We provideexperimental evidence that Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Dyadobacter,Porphyrobacter, and Variovorax are the key players in a Scenedesmus quadricaudaalga-bacteria interaction. We impart strong evidence that Dyadobacter producesand releases polysaccharides degradation enzymes and leucine-rich repeatproteins; Variovorax supplies the consortium with auxins and vitamin B12, whilePorphyrobacter produces a broad spectrum of B vitamins. We show not only that themicroalgae collaborate with the bacteria and vice versa but also that thebacteria interact with each other via quorum-sensing and secretion systemmechanisms. The shared currency between partners appears to be vitamins,microalgae growth-promoting substances, and dissolved carbon.

LID - 10.3791/63923 [doi]
AB  - Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has been gaining momentum in recent years,especially since the introduction of direct electron detectors, improvedautomated acquisition strategies, preparative techniques that expand thepossibilities of what the electron microscope can image at high-resolution using cryo-ET and new subtomogram averaging software. Additionally, data acquisitionhas become increasingly streamlined, making it more accessible to many users. TheSARS-CoV-2 pandemic has further accelerated remote cryo-electron microscopy(cryo-EM) data collection, especially for single-particle cryo-EM, in manyfacilities globally, providing uninterrupted user access to state-of-the-artinstruments during the pandemic. With the recent advances in Tomo5 (software for 3D electron tomography), remote cryo-ET data collection has become robust andeasy to handle from anywhere in the world. This article aims to provide adetailed walk-through, starting from the data collection setup in the tomography software for the process of a (remote) cryo-ET data collection session withdetailed troubleshooting. The (remote) data collection protocol is furthercomplemented with the workflow for structure determination at near-atomicresolution by subtomogram averaging with emClarity, using apoferritin as anexample.

TI  - Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutations on Its Activation by TMPRSS2 and theAlternative TMPRSS13 Protease.
PG  - e0137622
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01376-22 [doi]
AB  - The continuous emergence of new variants of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urges better understanding of the functional motifs inthe spike (S) protein and their tolerance to mutations. Here, we focused on theS2' motif, which, during virus entry, requires cleavage by a host cell proteaseto release the fusion peptide. Though belonging to an immunogenic region, theSARS-CoV-2 S2' motif (811-KPSKR-815) has shown hardly any variation, with itsthree basic (K/R) residues being >99.99% conserved thus far. By creating a seriesof mutant pseudoviruses bearing the spikes of Wuhan-Hu-1, its G614 mutant or the Delta and Omicron variants, we show that residue K814 (preceding the scissileR815) is dispensable for TMPRSS2 yet favored by the alternative TMPRSS13protease. Activation by TMPRSS13 was drastically reduced when the SARS-CoV-2 S2' motif was swapped with that of the low pathogenic 229E coronavirus(685-RVAGR-689), and also, the reverse effect was seen. This swap had no impacton recognition by TMPRSS2. In the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV) spike, introducing a dibasic scissile motif was easily accepted byTMPRSS13 but less so by TMPRSS2, confirming that TMPRSS13 favors a sequence rich in K/R residues. Pseudovirus entry experiments in Calu-3 cells confirmed that theS2' mutations have minor impact on TMPRSS2. Our findings are the first todemonstrate which S2' residues are important for SARS-CoV-2 spike activation bythese two airway proteases, with TMPRSS2 being more tolerant to variation thanTMPRSS13. This preemptive insight will help to estimate the impact of S2' motifchanges as they appear in new SARS-CoV-2 variants. IMPORTANCE Since itsintroduction in humans, SARS-CoV-2 is evolving with frequent appearance of newvariants. The surveillance would benefit from proactive characterization of thefunctional motifs in the spike (S) protein, the most variable viral factor. This is linked to immune evasion but also influences spike functioning. Remarkably,though located in a strongly immunogenic region, the S2' cleavage motif has, thusfar, remained highly conserved. This suggests that its sequence is critical forspike activation by airway proteases. To investigate this, we assessed howpseudovirus entry is affected by changes in the S2' motif. We demonstrate thatTMPRSS2 readily accepts variations in this motif, whereas the alternativeTMPRSS13 protease is more fastidious. The Wuhan-Hu-1, G614, Delta and Omicronspikes showed no difference in this regard. Being the first in its kind, ourstudy will help to assess the impact of S2' variations as soon as they aredetected during variant surveillance.

LID - 10.1128/mbio.01267-22 [doi]
AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are a leading cause of mortality worldwide.Excess mortality during IAV epidemics and pandemics is attributable to secondary bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Resident alveolar macrophages (rAMs) are early responders to respiratoryinfections that coordinate initial host defense responses. Maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTRs) are recently elucidated cysteinyl maresins that areproduced by and act on macrophages. Roles for MCTRs in responses to respiratoryinfections remain to be determined. Here, IAV infection led to transientdecreases in rAM numbers. Repopulated lung macrophages displayed transcriptional alterations 21 days post-IAV with prolonged susceptibility to secondarypneumococcal infection. Administration of a mix of MCTR1 to 3 or MCTR3 alonepost-IAV decreased lung inflammation and bacterial load 48 and 72 h aftersecondary pneumococcal infection. MCTR-exposed rAMs had increased migration andphagocytosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae, reduced secretion of CXCL1, and areversion toward baseline levels of several IAV-induced pneumonia susceptibility genes. Together, MCTRs counter regulated post-IAV changes in rAMs to promote arapid return of bacteria host defense. IMPORTANCE Secondary bacterial pneumoniais a serious and common complication of IAV infection, leading to excessmorbidity and mortality. New host-directed approaches are needed to complementantibiotics to better address this important global infectious disease. Here, we show that harnessing endogenous resolution mechanisms for inflammation byexogenous administration of a family of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e.,cys-MCTRs) increased macrophage resilience mechanisms after IAV to protectagainst secondary infection from Streptococcus pneumoniae.

AB  - Several infections have been associated with motor neuron diseases resemblingALS, including species of viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Mycobacterium aviumsubspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), most known for its probable etiologicassociation with Crohn's disease, has been suggested as another possibleinfectious cause of motor neuron disease. Two published case reports describe thesuccessful treatment of ALS-like symptoms with antimycobacterial antibiotics.Both cases had atypical features. Based on these, we believe it would bereasonable to begin performing chest imaging in PALS who have features of theirhistory or exam that are atypical for ALS such as pain, fevers, or eye movementabnormalities. If the chest imaging is abnormal, more specific testing formycobacteria may be indicated. Until there is more clear evidence of anassociation between mycobacteria and ALS, we cannot endorse the widespread use ofpotentially toxic antimycobacterial antibiotics for PALS.

TI  - A rare case of acute acalculous cholecystitis secondary to hantavirus infectionwith renal syndrome.
LID - 10.4149/BLL_2022_114 [doi]
AB  - Hantaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses. They are transmitted to humans byrodents and insectivore hosts. Some Hantavirus subtypes are the causative agents of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which is characterized byfever, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Hantavirus infection isdifficult to diagnose due to its non-specific clinical symptoms. Causes ofacalculous cholecystitis are severe trauma or burn, surgery, long-term starvationand some viral infections. It is very rare for Hantavirus to cause acuteacalculous cholecystitis. The treatment of acute acalculous cholecystitis isusually directed towards its symptoms. A 22-year-old male forest worker wasadmitted to our emergency outpatient clinic with the complaints of fatigue,oliguria, fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. After the clinical and laboratoryexaminations, HFRS and acute cholecystitis secondary to Hantavirus infection werediagnosed. The patient's condition and clinical findings improved aftersupportive treatment. Hantavirus infection should be considered in patients with acute kidney injury, cholecystitis and thrombocytopenia (Fig. 2, Ref. 10).Keywords: Hantavirus, acute kidney injury, acalculous cholecystitis,thrombocytopeni.

TI  - Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children and staff in German daycare centres.
PG  - e141
LID - 10.1017/S0950268822001194 [doi]
AB  - In daycare centres, the close contact of children with other children andemployees favours the transmission of infections. The majority of children <6years attend daycare programmes in Germany, but the role of daycare centres inthe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unclear. We investigated the transmission risk indaycare centres and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to associated households. 30 daycaregroups with at least one recent laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case wereenrolled in the study (10/2020-06/2021). Close contact persons within daycare andhouseholds were examined over a 12-day period (repeated SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests,genetic sequencing of viruses, symptom diary). Households were interviewed togain comprehensive information on each outbreak. We determined primary cases for all daycare groups. The number of secondary cases varied considerably betweendaycare groups. The pooled secondary attack rate (SAR) across all 30 daycarecentres was 9.6%. The SAR tended to be higher when the Alpha variant was detected(15.9% vs. 5.1% with evidence of wild type). The household SAR was 53.3%. Exposeddaycare children were less likely to get infected with SARS-CoV-2 than employees (7.7% vs. 15.5%). Containment measures in daycare programmes are critical toreduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially to avoid spread to associatedhouseholds.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal and highly contagious viral disease ofdomestic and wild pigs, listed as a notifiable disease reported to the WorldOrganization for Animal Health (OIE). Despite its limited host range and absentzoonotic potential, the socio-economic and environmental impact of ASF is veryhigh, representing a serious threat to the global swine industry and the manystakeholders involved. Currently, only control and eradication measures basedmainly on early detection and strict stamping-out policies are available,however, the rapid spread of the disease in new countries, and in new regions in countries already affected, show these strategies to be lacking. In this review, we discuss approaches to ASF vaccinology, with emphasis on the advances made overthe last decade, including the development of virulence-associated gene deletedstrains such as the very promising ASFV-G-DeltaI177L/DeltaLVR, that replicatesefficiently in a stable porcine epithelial cell line, and the cross-protectingBA71DeltaCD2 capable of stably growing in the commercial COS-1 cell line, or the naturally attenuated Lv17/WB/Rie1 which shows solid protection in wild boar. Wealso consider the key constraints involved in the scale-up and commercialization of promising live attenuated and virus-vectored vaccine candidates, namelycross-protection, safety, lack of suitable animal models, compatibility withwildlife immunization, availability of established and licensed cell lines, anddifferentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals may suffer a multi-organ system disorder known as"long COVID" or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). There are no standard treatments, the pathophysiology is unknown, and incidence varies byclinical phenotype. Acute COVID-19 correlates with biomarkers of systemicinflammation, hypercoagulability, and comorbidities that are less prominent inPASC. Macrovessel thrombosis, a hallmark of acute COVID-19, is less frequent inPASC. Female sex at birth is associated with reduced risk for acute COVID-19progression, but with increased risk of PASC. Persistent microvascularendotheliopathy associated with cryptic SARS-CoV-2 tissue reservoirs has beenimplicated in PASC pathology. Autoantibodies, localized inflammation, andreactivation of latent pathogens may also be involved, potentially leading tomicrovascular thrombosis, as documented in multiple PASC tissues. Diagnosticassays illuminating possible therapeutic targets are discussed.

TI  - Taking cues from convalescence to improve vaccines against hepatitis C virus.
LID - 10.1172/JCI161819 [doi]
LID - e161819 [pii]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a worldwide public health issue despitedirect-acting antivirals. A substantial proportion of infected individuals(15%-45%) spontaneously clear repeated HCV infections with genetically different viruses by generating broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). However,translating this response into an effective vaccine strategy has beenunsuccessful. In this issue of the JCI, Frumento and colleagues report on theirstudy of bNAb evolution longitudinally in convalescent individuals with repeated infections. Using pseudotyped viruses, well-characterized monoclonal antibodies, and complex modeling, the authors show that multiple exposures to antigenicallyrelated, antibody-sensitive viral envelope proteins induced potent bNAbs. Thiswork provides valuable insight into the best strategies for developing HCVvaccines in the future that may successfully reproduce the immunity inducedduring natural exposures.

TI  - Human TMPRSS2 non-catalytic ectodomain and SARS-CoV-2 S2' subunit interactionmediated SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis: a model proposal with virtual screening forpotential drug molecules to inhibit this interaction.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1080/07391102.2022.2105956 [doi]
AB  - This study proposes a novel model for integration of SARS-CoV-2 into host cellvia endocytosis as a possible alternative to the prevailing direct fusion model. It is known that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage atS1-S2 cleavage site and the cleaved S2 domain is primed by the activated serineprotease domain (SPD) of humanTMPRSS2 to become S2'. The activated SPD of TMPRSS2is formed after it is cleaved by autocatalysis from the membrane boundnon-catalytic ectodomain (hNECD) comprising of LDLRA CLASS-I repeat and a SRCRdomain. It is known that the SRCR domains as well as LDLRA repeat harboringproteins mediate endocytosis of viruses and certain ligands. Based on this, weput forward a hypothesis that the exposed hNECD binds to the S2' as both are atan interaction proximity soon after S2 is processed by the SPD and thisinteraction may lead to the endocytosis of virus. Based on this hypothesis wehave modelled the hNECD structure, followed by docking studies with the known 3D structure of S2'. The interaction interface of hNECD with S2' was further usedfor virtual screening of FDA-approved drug molecules and Indian medicinalplant-based compounds. We also mapped the known mutations of concern andmutations of interest on interaction interface of S2' and found that none of the known mutations map onto the interaction interface. This indicates that targetingthe interaction between the hNECD of TMPRSS2 and S2' may serve as an attractivetherapeutic target.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - While efficacy of chlorine against Phi6, a widely-used surrogate for pathogenicenveloped viruses, is well-documented, surfaces common to low-resource contextsare under-researched. We evaluated seven surfaces (stainless steel, plastic,nitrile, tarp, cloth, concrete, wood) and three environmentalconditions-temperature (4, 25, 40 degrees C), relative humidity (RH) (23, 85%),and soiling-to determine Phi6 recoverability and the efficacy of disinfectionwith 0.5% NaOCl. Overall, Phi6 recovery was >4 log10 PFU/mL on most surfacesafter drying 1 hour at all temperature/humidity conditions. After disinfection,all non-porous test conditions (48/48) achieved >/=4 LRV at 1 and 5 minutes ofexposure; significantly more non-porous surfaces met >/=4 LRV than porous (p <0.001). Comparing porous surfaces, significantly fewer wood samples met >/=4 LRV than cloth (p < 0.001); no differences were observed between concrete and either wood (p = 0.083) or cloth (p = 0.087). Lastly, no differences were observedbetween soil and no-soil conditions for all surfaces (p = 0.712). This studyhighlights infectious Phi6 is recoverable across a range of surfaces andenvironmental conditions, and confirms the efficacy of chlorine disinfection. We recommend treating all surfaces with suspect contamination as potentiallyinfectious, and disinfecting with 0.5% NaOCl for the minimum contact timerequired for the target enveloped virus (e.g. Ebola, SARS-CoV-2).

TI  - Oral alterations in children with microcephaly associated to congenital Zikasyndrome: A systematic review and meta-analyses.
LID - 10.1111/scd.12761 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To synthesize the oral alterations observed in children with microcephalyassociated with congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS); and to compare the oralalterations of these children to a normotypic healthy controls. METHODS ANDRESULTS: A search was performed in six electronic databases. Observationalstudies published that reported oral alterations in children with CZS wereselected. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed study quality, usingthe Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist tools, and the certaintyof evidence, using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development andEvaluation (GRADE) approach. Twenty-one studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled crude occurrence showed 88% of increasedsalivation (95%CI: 82%-94%), 83% of biofilm (95%CI: 75%-91%), and 73% of bruxism (95%CI: 52%-95%). Compared to normotypic controls, children with CZS-associatedmicrocephaly had a higher chance to have difficulty in lip sealing (OR: 18.28;95%CI: 1.42-235.91), inadequate lingual posture at rest (OR: 13.57; 95%CI:4.24-43.44), and delayed eruption (OR: 12.92; 95%CI: 3.42-48.78), with very lowcertainty. CONCLUSION: There are several oral alterations found among childrenwith CZS-associated microcephaly. They are more prone to present some of thesealterations, such as difficulty in lip sealing, although with very low certainty of evidence.

AB  - The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic provokes scientists to make a promptdevelopment of new effective therapeutic interventions for the battle againstSARS-CoV-2. A new series of N-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)-carboxamido derivatives were designed and synthesised based on the structural optimisation principle of theSARS-CoV Mpro co-crystallized WR1 inhibitor. Notably, compound 3b achieved themost promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity with an IC50 value of 174.7 microg/mL. Onthe other hand, compounds 3a, 3b, and 3c showed very promising SARS-CoV-2 Mproinhibitory effects with IC50 values of 4.67, 5.12, and 11.90 microg/mL,respectively. Compound 3b docking score was very promising (-6.94 kcal/mol) andits binding mode was nearly similar to that of WR1. Besides, the moleculardynamics (MD) simulations of compound 3b showed its great stability inside thebinding pocket until around 40 ns. Finally, a very promising SAR was concluded tohelp to design more powerful SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors shortly.

AB  - Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells are unconventional T cells that respondto glycolipid antigens found in microbes in a CD1d-dependent manner. iNKT cellsexert innate-like functions and produce copious amounts of cytokines, chemokines and cytotoxic molecules within only minutes of activation. As such, iNKT cellscan fuel or dampen inflammation in a context-dependent manner. In addition, iNKT cells provide potent immunity against bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi.Although microbiota-iNKT cell interactions are not well-characterized, mountingevidence suggests that microbiota colonization early in life impacts iNKT cellhomeostasis and functions in disease. In this study, we showed that CD1d(-/-) andValpha14 Tg mice, which lack and have increased numbers of iNKT cells,respectively, had no significant alterations in gut microbiota compositioncompared to their littermate controls. Furthermore, specific iNKT cell activationby glycolipid antigens only resulted in a transient and minimal shift inmicrobiota composition when compared to the natural drift found in our colony.Our findings demonstrate that iNKT cells have little to no influence inregulating commensal bacteria at steady state.Abbreviations: iNKT: invariantNatural Killer T cell; alphaGC: alpha-galactosylceramide.

AB  - AIMS: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is causally associated with many hematolymphoidmalignancies. This laboratory-based study aimed to establish the prevalence ofEBV in plasma cell neoplasms in a large South African cohort and to determinewhether there is any correlation between EBV-positivity and humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) status in patients with plasma cell neoplasms,including plasma cell myeloma and plasmacytoma (solitary plasmacytoma of bone andextraosseous plasmacytoma). METHODS: This single-institution retrospective study included all patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of plasma cell neoplasmbetween 2003 and 2020. EBV-expression in the plasma cell neoplasms was assessedby EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization (ISH) and correlated with HIVstatus. HIV status was determined by retrieving prior serologic results.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from HIV-unknown patients underwent HIV-1p24 antibody testing. RESULTS: Sixteen of 89 plasma cell neoplasms (18%) wereEBV-positive. There was a significant correlation between EBV and HIV infectionin plasma cell neoplasms, with 6/10 tumors from HIV positive patients showingEBV-positivity in tumor cells. The EBV-positive cohort was significantly younger than the EBV-negative group. CONCLUSION: EBV-positivity in plasma cell neoplasms in this study is higher than previously reported. The significant occurrence ofEBV in plasma cell neoplasms from HIV-positive patients suggests aco-carcinogenic relationship between the two viruses.

LID - 10.1080/10408398.2022.2105301 [doi]
AB  - The poor lipophilicity and instability of water-soluble polyphenols limit theirbioavailability and application in food. However, increasing attention has beengiven to water-soluble polyphenols due to their multiple biological activities,which prompts the modification of the structure of water-soluble polyphenols toimprove their lipophilicity and stability and enable more efficient application. This review presents the enzymatic biosynthesis of lipophilic derivatives ofwater-soluble polyphenols, which will change the molecular structure ofwater-soluble polyphenols based on the loss of hydroxyl or carboxyl groups.Therefore, the effects of reaction factors on the structure of polyphenolderivatives and the change in their bioactivities will be further analyzed.Previous studies have shown that lipases, solvent systems, and hydrophobic groupsare major factors influencing the synthesis and lipophilicity of polyphenolderivatives. Moreover, the biological activities of polyphenol derivatives werechanged to a certain extent, such as through the enhancement or weakening ofantioxidant activity in different systems and the increase in anti-influenzavirus activity and antibacterial activity. The improvement of lipophilicity also expands polyphenol application in food. This review may contribute to theefficient synthesis of lipophilic derivatives of water-soluble polyphenols toextend the utilization and application range of polyphenols.

PG  - e01576
LID - 10.1016/j.idcr.2022.e01576 [doi]
AB  - Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is most commonly associated with Acquired ImmunodeficiencySyndrome (AIDS). Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus is thought to play a huge role in thepathogenesis of KS. The diagnosis and management of KS can be quite challenging, and Physicians need high index of suspicion to diagnose KS as it can be mistaken for other skin pathologies. We present a case of a young male who developed KS onthe penis as the initial manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and AIDS. Initially, he presented with a painful non-resolving ulcer on theglans penis for 2 weeks. He tested positive for HIV and his HIV viral load wasmore than 200,000 copies with CD4 count being only 8 per microliter.Histopathological examination of the lesion along with immunohistologicalstaining were positive for KS. The patient was not adherent to his antiretroviraltherapy (ART), and his condition deteriorated. Literature review showed only 16cases of HIV positive patients presenting with KS involving the penile area, withonly 4 of them being the initial manifestation of HIV and AIDS. A combination of systemic chemotherapy and ART is often needed for visceral or metastatic KS.There is a huge need to increase awareness about HIV and related complicationsamong health care providers and the general population.

AB  - Onosma roots are widely used in traditional medicine to treat various diseasesthroughout the world. In this study, for the first time, we investigated thecomponent composition and biological activity of various extracts from the roots of Onosma gmelinii collected in the highlands of the Kakpakty Mountains of theAlmaty region (Republic of Kazakhstan). Extracts were obtained by three differentmethods: percolation extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, andsupercritical carbon dioxide extraction. The component composition of theextracts was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS),naphthoquinones by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and spectrophotometricmethod. In this study, the presence of shikonin and its derivatives in theextracts was confirmed. The concentration of naphthoquinones during CO2extraction was about 40%, during ultrasonic extraction about 3%, and duringpercolation extraction about 1.3%. The GC-MS method identified 69 chemicalcompounds in the ultrasonic extract, 46 compounds in the CO2 extract, and 51compounds in the percolation extract. The extracts were tested on a panel ofbacteria and viruses: two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 8739,Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027); nine Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcusaureus ATCC 6538-P, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-39, Staphylococcus epidermidisATCC 51625, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC19615, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC BAA-660, Enterococcus hirae ATCC 10541,Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 51575, Enterococcus faecium ATCC 700221); and twofungal species (Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Candida albicans ATCC 2091); fivesubtypes of influenza virus A (A/FPV/Weybridge/78 (H7N7), A/Swine/Iowa/15/30(H1N1), A/black-headed gull/Atyrau/743/04 (H13N6), A/FPV/Rostock/1934 (H7N1),A/Almaty/8/98 (H3N2)). The root extracts of Onosma gmelinii showed antibacterial activity in different degrees against all tested Gram-positive bacterial strains,while no inhibitory effect on Gram-negative bacteria was observed. The resultsindicated that the ultrasonic extract effectively inhibits the growth of themajority of tested Gram-positive bacteria (MBC from 18.3 to 293.0 microg/mL). CO2extract had the greatest bactericidal activity (MBC from 0.1 to 24.4 microg/mL). Percolation extract insignificantly inhibited bacterial growth (MBC from 2343.8to 4687.5 microg/mL). CO2 extract and ultrasonic extract significantly reducedthe activity of C. albicans. The results of the antiviral action showed that the ultrasonic extract has the greatest effectiveness against different subtypes ofthe influenza virus A, while other extracts did not show significant activity.

AB  - In the pathophysiology of COVID-19, immunomodulatory factors play a vital role.Viruses have epigenetic effects on various genes, particularly methylation.Explaining the changes in immunological factor methylation levels during viralinfections requires substantial consideration. HLA-C is a crucial determinant of immune function and NK cell activity and is primarily implicated in viralinfections. This research focused on studying HLA-C methylation in COVID-19patients with different severity. Peripheral blood samples were collected from470 patients (235 men and 235 women) with RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 test andclassified into moderate, severe, and critical groups based on WHO criteria.Also, one hundred (50 men and 50 women) healthy subjects were selected as thecontrol group. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used for DNA extraction,and the methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method and gel electrophoresis were usedto determine the methylation status of the HLA-C. Significant statisticaldifferences in HLA-C methylation were observed among cases and controls andvarious stages of the disease. HLA-C methylation in men and women has decreasedin all stages (p < 0.05). In comparison with control, HLA-C methylation in bothgenders were as follows: moderate (women: 41.0%, men: 52.33%), severe (women:43.42%, men: 64.86%), critical (women: 42.33%, men: 60.07%), and total patients(women: 45.52%, men: 56.97%). Furthermore, the methylation levels in men werehigher than in women in all groups (p < 0.05). Significantly, among all groups,the severe group of men participants showed the highest methylation percentage (p< 0.05). No significant differences were detected for different disease severity in the women group (p > 0.1). This study found that HLA-C methylation wassignificantly lower in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity. Therewere also significant differences in HLA-C methylation between men and womenpatients with different severity. Therefore, during managing viral infections,particularly COVID-19, it is critical to consider patient gender and diseaseseverity.

AB  - We conducted a single-center 5-year retrospective study on the occurrence ofhemorrhagic cystitis (HC) and its effect on survival after haploid high-doseperipheral blood stem cell transplantation (haplo-PBSCT) in patients with acuteleukemia. We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients with acute leukemia who weretreated with non-in vitro T-cell depleted haplo-PBSCT and myeloablativeconditioning regimen. All patients were followed up for more than 180 days after transplantation. HC occurrence and its effect on long-term progression freesurvival (PFS) were retrospectively analyzed. Totally, 64 out of 153 patients hadlate onset HC (LOHC). No early onset HC occurred. The median onset time was 38.5 (17-163) days after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of LOHC was 41.8%. The cumulative incidence of LOHC in patients under 27 years old (50.0%) and inALL patients (54.1%) was significantly higher than that in patients over 27 yearsold (34.5%) and in AML patients (36.9%), respectively. The cumulative incidenceof mild LOHC was 44.2% and that of severe LOHC was 28.6%. However, urine copiesof BK virus were not related to LOHC duration. There was no significantdifference in 3-year expected PFS between AML and ALL patients with and withoutLOHC, or between LOHC duration more than and less than 38.5 days (P>0.05).Conclusively, LOHC incidence is higher in patients under 27 years old and in ALL patients. LOHC occurrence is related to urine BK virus copy, but not blood BKvirus load. LOHC duration and severity has no significant effect on PFS.

AB  - The human skin hosts millions of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses. Theseskin microbes play a crucial role in human immunological and physiologicalfunctions, as well as the development of skin diseases, including cancer when thebalance between skin commensals and pathogens is interrupted. Due to the linkagesbetween inflammation processes and skin microbes, and viral links to skin cancer,new theories have supported the role a dysbiotic skin microbiome plays in thedevelopment of cancer and cancer treatment-related skin toxicities. This reviewfocuses on the skin microbiome and its role in cancer treatment-related skintoxicities, particularly from chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy.The current literature found changes in the diversity and abundance of the skinmicrobiome during cancer treatments such as radiation therapy, including lowerdiversity of the skin microbiome, an increased Proteobacteria/Firmicutes ratio,and a higher abundance of pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. These changes may be associated with the development and severity of treatment-related skintoxicities, such as acute radiation dermatitis, hand-foot syndrome inchemotherapy, and immunotherapy-induced rash. Several clinical guidelines haveissued potential interventions (e.g., use of topical corticosteroids,phototherapy, and non-pharmaceutical skin care products) to prevent and treatskin toxicities. The effectiveness of these promising interventions inalleviating treatment-related skin toxicities should be further tested amongcancer patients.

AB  - Cervical cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death all over the world.Most diseases such as cervical epithelial atypical hyperplasia and invasivecervical cancer are closely related to the continuous infection of high-risktypes of human papillomavirus. Therefore, the high-risk types of humanpapillomavirus are the key to the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer.With the accumulation of high-throughput and clinical data, the use of systematicand quantitative methods for mathematical modeling and computational predictionhas become more and more important. This paper summarizes the mathematical modelsand prediction methods of the risk types of human papillomavirus, especiallyaround the key steps such as feature extraction, feature selection, andprediction algorithms. We summarized and discussed the advantages anddisadvantages of existing algorithms, which provides a theoretical basis forfollow-up research.

LID - 10.1093/tas/txac093 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of increasing tracemineral (TM) supplementation on finishing cattle performance, carcasscharacteristics, TM balance, and antibody concentrations. Commercial Angus steers(n = 240; body weight, BW = 291 kg +/- 27.4) were stratified by arrival BW andsource and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental treatments in a randomizedcomplete block design (12 pens/treatment; 5 steers/pen). All steers underwent aTM depletion period for a minimum of 42-d prior to the administrationexperimental treatments. Treatments included a negative control (CON) in whichcattle received no additional TM supplementation or TM supplementation treatmentsin which cattle received added Co, Cu, I, Mn, Se, or Zn from inorganic TM sourcesat 2016 Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle (NASEM) requirement levels (1X), at 2 times NASEM requirements (2X), or at 4 times NASEM requirements (4X). Selenium was included at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg for 1X, 2X, and 4X respectively, based onfederal law. There was no difference in overall BW, average daily gain (ADG), drymatter intake (DMI), or gain to feed (G:F) due to TM supplementation (CON vs.SUPP P >/= 0.47). There was no difference in hot carcass weight, rib eye area,fat thickness, dressing percentage, marbling score, or USDA Yield Grade due to TMsupplementation (CON vs. SUPP P >/= 0.30). One steer was chosen at random fromeach pen to be evaluated for serum and liver TM status and antibodyconcentrations to common respiratory viruses. There was a treatment x dayinteraction for serum Co and liver Cu and Se (P < 0.0001). Serum Co was greatest for the 4X treatment from d 28 through harvest. Liver Cu was greatest for the 2X and 4X treatments from d 56 through harvest. Liver Se was greatest for 2X and 4X from d 28 through harvest. Serum Zn was greatest for the 4X treatment (P = 0.02).There was an effect of day on liver Co, Fe, Mn, Mo, and Zn (P </= 0.0001) andserum Cu, Mn, Mo, Se, and Zn (P </= 0.002). Concentrations for individual TM had different trends over time, however, all reported values were within normalranges. There was an effect of time on bovine viral diarrhea virus Type 1A,bovine herpesvirus type 1, and bovine parainfluenza 3 virus antibodyconcentrations (P </= 0.0001). Supplementation of TM above NASEM requirements didnot affect overall cattle performance, carcass characteristics, or antibodyconcentrations, but did affect the storage and circulation of certain TM.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most serious publichealth threat faced by mankind. Thus, the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is being intensivelyinvestigated. Several vaccines are now available for clinical use. However, owingto the highly mutated nature of RNA viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 is changing at arapid speed. Breakthrough infections by SARS-CoV-2 variants have been seen invaccinated individuals. As a result, effective therapeutics for treating COVID-19patients is urgently required. With the advance of computer technology,computational methods have become increasingly powerful in the biomedicalresearch and pharmaceutical drug discovery. The applications of these techniques have largely reduced the costs and simplified processes of pharmaceutical drugdevelopments. Intensive and extensive studies on SARS-CoV-2 proteins have beencarried out and three-dimensional structures of the major SARS-CoV-2 proteinshave been resolved and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. These structuresprovide the foundations for drug discovery and design using the structure-basedcomputations, such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Inthis review, introduction to the applications of computational methods in thediscovery and design of novel drugs and repurposing of existing drugs for thetreatments of COVID-19 is given. The examples of computer-aided investigationsand screening of COVID-19 effective therapeutic compounds, functional peptides,as well as effective molecules from the herb medicines are discussed.

TI  - Propagation of H1N1 virus through saliva movement in oesophagus: a mathematicalmodel.
PG  - 866
LID - 10.1140/epjp/s13360-022-03070-2 [doi]
AB  - H1N1 (Swine flu) is caused by the influenza A virus which belongs to theOrthomyxoviridae family. Influenza A is very harmful to the elderly, and peoplewith chronic respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it isessential to analyse the behaviour of virus transmission through the salivamovement in oesophagus. A mathematical paradigm is developed to study the saliva movement under the applications of transverse magnetic field. Jeffrey fluid modelis considered for saliva to show the viscoelastic nature. The flow nature isconsidered creeping and assumptions of long wavelength and low Reynolds numberare adopted for analytical solutions. The Basset-Boussinesq-Oseen equation isemployed to understand the propagation of H1N1 virus through saliva under theeffect of applicable forces such as gravity, virtual mass, basset force, and dragforces. The suitable data for saliva, oesophagus and H1N1 virus are taken fromthe existing literature for simulation of the results using MATLAB software. Fromthe graphical results, it is observed that the susceptibility to viral infectionsis less because the magnetic field reduces the motion of the virus particle.Further, the chances of infections in males are more as compared to females andchildren due to variation in viscosity of saliva. Such findings provide anunderstanding of the mechanics of the virus floating through the saliva(viscoelastic fluids) in the oesophagus.

TI  - From Immunosuppression to Immunomodulation - Turning Cold Tumours into Hot.

LID - 10.7150/jca.71992 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells employ various mechanisms to evade and suppress anti-cancer immuneresponses generating a "cold" immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment.Oncolytic viruses are a promising tool to convert tumour immunosuppression toimmunomodulation and improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. Emergingpreclinical and clinical findings confirm that oncolytic viruses act in amultimodal scheme, triggering lyses, immunogenic cell death and finally inducing anti-cancer immune responses. In this paper, we tested the local administrationof a novel oncolytic adenovirus AdV-D24-ICOSL-CD40L expressing co-stimulatorymolecules ICOSL and CD40L to induce the production of tumour infiltratinglymphocytes to the site of injection. Subsequently, in immunocompetent mousemodels, we studied possible correlation between tumour infiltrates andanti-cancer efficacy. Described results showed that the delivery of oncolyticviruses encoding immunomodulatory transgenes in combination with anti-PD1resulted in synergistic inhibition of both melanoma and mesothelioma tumours.Importantly anti-cancer effect positively correlated with cytotoxic CD8+tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes exerting a central role in the tumour volumecontrol thus generating beneficial outcomes that will undoubtedly provide newinsights into possible future treatment strategies to combat cancer. Altogetherour findings highlight the importance of oncolytic vectors able to modulateanti-cancer immune responses that can correlate with efficacy in solidmalignancies.

TI  - Non-Invasive Prediction Models for Esophageal Varices and Red Signs in PatientsWith Hepatitis B Virus-Related Liver Cirrhosis.
PG  - 930762
LID - 10.3389/fmolb.2022.930762 [doi]
AB  - Background: Red signs are closely related to esophageal variceal bleeding, and,despite improvements in therapy, the mortality rate remains high. We aimed toidentify non-invasive predictors of esophageal varices and red signs in patients with hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis. Methods: This retrospective studyincluded 356 patients with hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis afterapplying inclusion and exclusion criteria among 661 patients. All patientsunderwent endoscopy, ultrasonography, laboratory examinations, and computedtomography/magnetic resonance imaging. Univariate and multivariate logisticregression analysis were performed, and prediction models for esophageal varices and red signs were constructed. Results: Multivariate analysis revealed thatspleen diameter, splenic vein diameter, and lymphocyte ratio were independentrisk factors for esophageal varices and red signs. On this basis, we proposed twomodels: i) a spleen diameter-splenic vein diameter-lymphocyte ratio-esophagealvarices prediction model (SSL-EV model); and ii) a spleen diameter-splenic veindiameter-lymphocyte ratio-red sign prediction model (SSL-RS model). The areasunder the receiver operating characteristic curve for the two prediction modelswere 0.843 and 0.783, respectively. With a cutoff value of 1.55, the firstprediction model had 81.3% sensitivity and 76.1% specificity for esophagealvarices prediction. With a cutoff value of -0.20, the second prediction model had72.1% sensitivity and 70.7% specificity for the prediction of red signs.Conclusions: We proposed a new statistical model, the spleen diameter-splenicvein diameter-lymphocyte ratio-red sign prediction model (SSL-RS model), topredict the presence of red signs non-invasively. Combined with the spleendiameter-splenic vein diameter-lymphocyte ratio-esophageal varices predictionmodel (SSL-EV model), these non-invasive prediction models will be helpful inguiding clinical decision-making and preventing the occurrence of esophagealvariceal bleeding.

AB  - Starting from December 2020, vaccination against COVID-19 became available inRomania. There are a lot of uncertainties regarding the kinetics of immunity and its persistance over time. This is a small prospective study developed betweenJanuary-September 2021 in the Infectious Diseases Clinic from Craiova andcomprising 61 subjects immunised with BNT162b2 (Comirnaty). We have found thatafter two doses of vaccine there is a strong humoral response, but the immunitylowers six months later. Subjects with a diagnosis of COVID-19, previously or in between the two doses, have had the most significant immunological response, but,also, the sharpest decline in antibody titer. The immune response seems to be thesame, regardless the gender of the subjects. There are a variety of responses at the individual level, but overall vaccine effectiveness is 96.72% two weeksfollowing immunisation and 88.52% after six months; however for those who havebeen in contact with the virus, they all had an antibody titer well above thelaboratory limit.

AB  - Since December 2019, the time when the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was spotted, numerous review studies have beenpublished on COVID-19 and its neuro invasion. A growing number of studies havereported headaches as a common neurological manifestation of COVID-19. Althoughseveral hypotheses have been proposed regarding the association between headache and the coronavirus, no solid evidence has been presented for the mechanism andfeatures of headache in COVID-19. Headache also is a common complaint with theomicron variant of the virus. COVID-19 vaccination also is a cause of new-onsetheadaches or aggravation of the previous headache in migraine or tension headachesufferers. In this review study, the types of headaches reported in previousstudies and their possible pathogenic mechanisms are outlined. To accomplish thisobjective, various types of headaches are classified and their patterns arediscussed according to ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria, including, headachesattributed to systemic viral infection, viral meningitis or encephalitis,non-infectious inflammatory intracranial disease, hypoxia and/or hypercapnia,cranial or cervical vascular disorder, increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)pressure, refractive error, external-compression headache, and cough headache.Then, their pathogeneses are categorized into three main categories, directtrigeminal involvement, vascular invasion, and inflammatory mediators.Furthermore, persistent headache after recovery and the predictors of intensityis further investigated. Post-vaccination headache is also discussed in thisreview.

AB  - Since the beginning of 2020, a remarkably low incidence of respiratory virushospitalizations has been reported worldwide. We prospectively evaluated 587children, aged <12 years, admitted for respiratory tract infections from 1September 2021 to 15 March 2022 in four Italian pediatric hospitals to assess theburden of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Atadmission, a Clinical Respiratory Score was assigned and nasopharyngeal or nasal washing samples were collected and tested for respiratory viruses. Totaladmissions increased from the second half of October 2021 to the first half ofDecember 2021 with a peak in early November 2021. The respiratory syncytial virus(RSV) incidence curve coincided with the total hospitalizations curve, occurredearlier than in the pre-pandemic years, and showed an opposite trend with respectto the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2. Our results demonstrated an early peak inpediatric hospitalizations for RSV. SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit a competitive pressureon other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV.

AB  - Optimized methods for the detection of flavivirus infections in hyperendemicareas are still needed, especially for working with patient serum as a startingmaterial. The focus-forming assay (FFA) reveals critical aspects of virus-hostinteractions, as it is a quantitative assay to determine viral loads. Automatedimage analysis provides evaluations of relative amounts of intracellular viralprotein at the single-cell level. Here, we developed an optimized FFA for thedetection of infectious Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) viral particlesin cell cultures and clinical serum samples, respectively. Vero-76 cells wereinfected with DENV-2 (16681) or ZIKV (PRVA BC59). Using a panel of anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the primary mAbs,concentration, and the optimal time of infection were determined. To determinewhether intracellular accumulation of NS1 improved the efficiency of the FFA,brefeldin A was added to the cultures. Focus formation was identified byconventional optical microscopy combined with CellProfiler automated imageanalysis software. The FFA was used with spike assays for ZIKV and clinicalspecimens from natural infection by DENV-1 and DENV-2. mAb 7744-644 for ZIKV and mAb 724-323 for DENV used at a concentration of 1 mug/ml and a time of 24 hourspostinfection produced the best detection of foci when combining conventionalcounting and automated digital analysis. Brefeldin A did not improve theassessment of FFUs or their digitally assessed intensity at single-cell level.The FFA showed 95% ZIKV recovery and achieved the detection of circulating DENV-1and DENV-2 in the plasma of acutely ill patients. The combination of the twotechniques optimized the FFA, allowing the study of DENV and ZIKV in culturesupernatants and clinical specimens from natural infection in hyperendemic areas.

AB  - The first case of pneumonia of unknown origin was identified in Wuhan, thecapital city of Hubei province situated in the Republic of China. The pathogenic organism that has been identified as a causative organism is a novel envelopedRNA betacoronavirus which has been designated as' severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome Coronavirus- 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus has been found to have a similarphylogeny to SARS-CoV. The novel Coronavirus or COVID-19 can be symptomizedthrough clinical manifestations like- Pyrexia or fever, Cough, Dyspnea/difficultyin breathing, Myalgia/muscle pain, and constant fatigue. In the later stages,these symptoms worsen leading to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distresssyndrome, sepsis, and multiple organ failure. These days, this pandemic isemerging as a major threat for dental health-care professionals. The dentalsurgeons are at greater risk of novel coronavirus infections due to directcontact with infected patients and exposure to contaminated blood, saliva, andother body fluids. This article deals with viral structure, clinical symptoms,and modes of transmission, recommended measures to prevent its spread in dentaloperatories.

TI  - Factors Associated with HIV Risk and Vulnerability Among Injecting Drug Users in Afghanistan: A Narrative Review.
PG  - 331-339
LID - 10.2147/HIV.S366970 [doi]
AB  - The number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases in Afghanistan isincreasing mainly associated with injecting drug use (IDU). This study aimed toexplore the risk and vulnerability factors associated with HIV infection amonginjecting drug users (IDUs) in Afghanistan in order to contribute to improvingthe response and reversing the concentrated HIV epidemic among this group. Anarrative review of the literature was conducted to reach the objective. Themodified social ecological model was used as conceptual framework for analysis ofthe HIV risk and vulnerability factors among IDUs at five levels. At the"individual level", the injecting risk behaviors among IDUs such as sharing theinjecting equipment and their sexual risk behaviors like unprotected sexualcontact with multiple partners identified as immediate factors that put them atrisk of HIV infection. At the "network level", lack of HIV knowledge and lowuptake of the harm reduction services were identified as the factors thatincrease their vulnerability. At the "community level", massive drug productionand easy access to illicit drugs, armed conflicts, massive internal and external migration, unemployment and poverty, high stigma and discrimination against IDUs,unsafe injecting locations such as under the bridges; and at the "public policylevel", punitive drug laws, and weak national political response to HIV and IDUwere identified as determinants that add to the IDUs vulnerability to HIV. At the"stage of epidemic level", the concentrated HIV epidemic among IDUs in thecountry poses a potential risk to uninfected IDUs and beyond. In conclusion, the IDUs in Afghanistan are highly at risk and vulnerable to HIV. An informed andmultisectoral response is required to control the epidemic. A rapid expansion of the harm reduction interventions is urgently needed.

AB  - Senecavirus A (SVA), also known as Seneca Valley virus, is a recently discovered picornavirus that can cause swine vesicular disease, posing a great threat to theglobal swine industry. It can replicate efficiently in cells, but the molecularmechanism remains poorly understood. This study determined the host'sdifferentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during SVA infection using dimethyllabeling based on quantitative proteomics. Among the DE proteins, DDX21, a memberof the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box RNA helicase (DDX) family, was downregulatedand demonstrated inhibiting SVA replication by overexpression and knockdownexperiment. To antagonize this antiviral effect of DDX21, SVA infection inducesthe degradation of DDX21 by 2B and 3C proteins. The Co-IP results showed that 2B and 3C did not interact with DDX21, suggesting that the degradation of DDX21 did not depend on their interaction. Moreover, the 3C protein protease activity wasnecessary for the degradation of DDX21. Furthermore, our study revealed that the degradation of DDX21 by 2B and 3C proteins of SVA was achieved through thecaspase pathway. These findings suggest that DDX21 was an effective antiviralfactor for suppressing SVA infection and that SVA antagonized its antiviraleffect by degrading DDX21, which will be useful to guide further studies into themechanism of mutual regulation between SVA and the host.

AB  - Since 2019, the coronavirus (COVID-19) has outbroken continuously, spreadinginternationally and threatening the public health. However, it was unknown howthe disorder at the single-cell level was associated with the pathogenesis ofCOVID-19. This study presented the disorders of macrophages, epithelial cells,CD8(+) T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells at the single-cell level in thecourses of COVID-19 and analyzed the immune response to cytokine storm. Compared with the healthy group, patients with COVID-19 had higher proportions ofmacrophages and lower proportions of T and NK cells, especially proportions ofmacrophages and epithelial cells with an increase during patients' conditionsfrom mild to severe. This study suggested that there were high levels ofpro-inflammatory and chemokine expressions in cells of COVID-19 and analyzed cellsubsets to explore its changes and pathways. It was worth noting that severalsubsets of macrophages, epithelial cells, CD8 T cells, and NK cells were involvedin inflammation pathways, including interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway. Moreover, the pathways interactingCOVID-19 and cytokine receptor with each other were remarkably enriched. Inaddition, these cell subsets played important roles in inflammation, and theirabnormal functions may cause COVID-19. In conclusion, this study provided animmune outlook for COVID-19 at the single-cell level and revealed differentpathways in immune response of COVID-19 single cells.

TI  - Host KIR/HLA-C Genotypes Determine HIV-Mediated Changes of the NK Cell Repertoireand Are Associated With Vpu Sequence Variations Impacting Downmodulation ofHLA-C.
PG  - 922252
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.922252 [doi]
AB  - NK cells play a pivotal role in viral immunity, utilizing a large array ofactivating and inhibitory receptors to identify and eliminate virus-infectedcells. Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) represent a highlypolymorphic receptor family, regulating NK cell activity and determining theability to recognize target cells. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class Imolecules serve as the primary ligand for KIRs. Herein, HLA-C stands out as beingthe dominant ligand for the majority of KIRs. Accumulating evidence indicatedthat interactions between HLA-C and its inhibitory KIR2DL receptors(KIR2DL1/L2/L3) can drive HIV-1-mediated immune evasion and thus may contributeto the intrinsic control of HIV-1 infection. Of particular interest in thiscontext is the recent observation that HIV-1 is able to adapt to host HLA-Cgenotypes through Vpu-mediated downmodulation of HLA-C. However, ourunderstanding of the complex interplay between KIR/HLA immunogenetics, NKcell-mediated immune pressure and HIV-1 immune escape is still limited.Therefore, we investigated the impact of specific KIR/HLA-C combinations on theNK cell receptor repertoire and HIV-1 Vpu protein sequence variations of 122viremic, untreated HIV-1(+) individuals. Compared to 60 HIV-1(-) controls, HIV-1 infection was associated with significant changes within the NK cell receptorrepertoire, including reduced percentages of NK cells expressing NKG2A, CD8, and KIR2DS4. In contrast, the NKG2C(+) and KIR3DL2(+) NK cell sub-populations fromHIV-1(+) individuals was enlarged compared to HIV-1(-) controls. Stratificationalong KIR/HLA-C genotypes revealed a genotype-dependent expansion of KIR2DL1(+)NK cells that was ultimately associated with increased binding affinities betweenKIR2DL1 and HLA-C allotypes. Lastly, our data hinted to a preferential selection of Vpu sequence variants that were associated with HLA-C downmodulation inindividuals with high KIR2DL/HLA-C binding affinities. Altogether, our studyprovides evidence that HIV-1-associated changes in the KIR repertoire of NK cellsare to some extent predetermined by host KIR2DL/HLA-C genotypes. Furthermore,analysis of Vpu sequence polymorphisms indicates that differential KIR2DL/HLA-Cbinding affinities may serve as an additional mechanism how host genetics impact immune evasion by HIV-1.

AB  - Marburg virus (MARV) is one of the most harmful zoonotic viruses with deadlyeffects on both humans and nonhuman primates. Because of its severe outbreakswith a high rate of fatality, the world health organization put it as a riskgroup 4 pathogen and focused on the urgent need for the development of effective solutions against that virus. However, up to date, there is no effective vaccine against MARV in the market. In the current study, the complete proteome of MARV(seven proteins) was analyzed for the antigenicity score and the virulence orphysiological role of each protein where we nominated envelope glycoprotein (Gp),Transcriptional activator (VP30), and membrane-associated protein (VP24) as thecandidates for epitope prediction. Following that, a vaccine construct wasdesigned based on CTL, HTL, and BCL epitopes of the selected protein candidatesand to finalize the vaccine construct, several amino acid linkers, beta-defensin adjuvant, and PADRE peptides were incorporated. The generated potential vaccinewas assessed computationally for several properties such as antigenicity,allergenicity, stability, and other structural features where the outcomes ofthese assessments nominated this potential vaccine to be validated for itsbinding affinity with two molecular targets TLR-8 and TLR-4. The binding scoreand the stability of the vaccine-receptor complex, which was deeply studiedthrough molecular docking-coupled dynamics simulation, supported the selection ofour designed vaccine as a putative solution for MARV that should be validatedthrough future wet-lab experiments. Here, we describe the computational approach for designing and analysis of this potential vaccine.

CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells and neutralizing antibodies allcontribute to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, heterogeneity is a majorfactor in disease severity and in immune innate and adaptive responses toSARS-CoV-2. We performed a deep analysis by flow cytometry of lymphocytepopulations of 125 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients on the day ofhospital admission. Five clusters of patients were identified using hierarchical classification on the basis of their immunophenotypic profile, with differentmortality outcomes. Some characteristics were observed in all the clusters ofpatients, such as lymphopenia and an elevated level of effector CD8(+)CCR7(-) Tcells. However, low levels of T cell activation are associated to a betterdisease outcome; on the other hand, profound CD8(+) T-cell lymphopenia, a highlevel of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell activation and a high level of CD8(+) T-cellsenescence are associated with a higher mortality outcome. Furthermore, a clusterof patient was characterized by high B-cell responses with an extremely highlevel of plasmablasts. Our study points out the prognostic value of lymphocyteparameters such as T-cell activation and senescence and strengthen the interestin treating the patients early in course of the disease with targetedimmunomodulatory therapies based on the type of adaptive response of eachpatient.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has occurred due to infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2coronavirus, which impacts gestation and pregnancy. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, onlyvery rare cases of vertical transmission have been reported, suggesting thatfetal immune imprinting due to a maternal infection is probably a result ofchanges in maternal immunity. Natural killer (NK) cells are the leading maternal immune cells that act as a natural defense system to fight infections. They also play a pivotal role in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Whileperipheral NK cells display specific features in patients infected withSARS-CoV-2 in the general population, information remains elusive in pregnantmothers and neonates. In the present study, we analyzed the characteristics of NKcells isolated from both neonatal umbilical cord blood and maternal peripheralblood close to the time of delivery. Phenotype and functions were compared in 18 healthy pregnant women and 34 COVID-19 patients during pregnancy within anongoing infection (PCR(+); N = 15) or after recovery (IgG(+)PCR(-); N = 19). The frequency of NK cells from infected women and their neonates was correlated with the production of inflammatory cytokines in the serum. The expression of NKG2Aand NKp30, as well as degranulation of NK cells in pregnant women with ongoinginfection, were both negatively correlated to estradiol level. Furthermore, NKcells from the neonates born to infected women were significantly decreased andalso correlated to estradiol level. This study highlights the relationshipbetween NK cells, inflammation, and estradiol in patients with ongoing infection,providing new insights into the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on theneonate.

AB  - SARS-CoV2 infection in pregnancy and exposed newborns is poorly known. Weperformed a longitudinal analysis of immune system and determined solublecytokine levels in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV2 and in their newborns. Women with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection and their exposed uninfected newbornswere recruited from Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon. Peripheralblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), cord cells and plasma were collected at birthand 6 months later. Immunophenotyping of natural killer (NK), monocytes andCD4/CD8 T-cells were studied in cryopreserved PBMCs and cord cells bymultiparametric flow cytometry. Up to 4 soluble pro/anti-inflammatory cytokineswere assessed in plasma/cord plasma by ELISA assay. SARS-CoV2-infected mothersand their newborns were compared to matched healthy non-SARS-CoV2-infectedmothers and their newborns. The TNFalpha and IL-10 levels of infected motherswere higher at baseline than those of healthy controls. Infected mothers showedincreased NK cells activation and reduced expression of maturation markers thatreverted after 6 months. They also had high levels of Central Memory and lowEffector Memory CD4-T cell subsets. Additionally, the increased CD4- and CD8-Tcell activation (CD154 and CD38) and exhaustion (TIM3/TIGIT) levels at baselinecompared to controls remained elevated after 6 months. Regarding Treg cells, the levels were lower at infected mothers at baseline but reverted after 6 months. Nonewborn was infected at birth. The lower levels of monocytes, NK and CD4-T cells observed at SARS-CoV2-exposed newborns compared to unexposed controlssignificantly increased 6 months later. In conclusion, SARS-CoV2 infection duringpregnancy shows differences in immunological components that could lead newborns to future clinical implications after birth. However, SARS-CoV2 exposed6-months-old newborns showed no immune misbalance, whereas the infected mothersmaintain increased activation and exhaustion levels in T-cells after 6 months.

AB  - We assessed if immune responses are enhanced in CD-1 mice by heterologousvaccination with two different nucleic acid-based COVID-19 vaccines: anext-generation human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5)-vectored dual-antigen spike(S) and nucleocapsid (N) vaccine (AdS+N) and a self-amplifying and -adjuvanted S RNA vaccine (AAHI-SC2) delivered by a nanostructured lipid carrier. The AdS+Nvaccine encodes S modified with a fusion motif to increase cell-surfaceexpression and an N antigen modified with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain(N-ETSD) to direct N to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment and increase MHCclass I and II stimulation potential. The S sequence in the AAHI-SC2 vaccinecomprises the D614G mutation, two prolines to stabilize S in the prefusionconformation, and 3 glutamines in the furin cleavage region to confer proteaseresistance. CD-1 mice received vaccination by homologous and heterologous prime >boost combinations. Humoral responses to S were the highest with any regimen thatincluded the AAHI-SC2 vaccine, and IgG bound to wild type and Delta (B.1.617.2)variant S1 at similar levels. An AAHI-SC2 prime followed by an AdS+N boostparticularly enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to both wild type and Delta S peptides relative to all other vaccine regimens. Sera from mice receivingAAHI-SC2 homologous or heterologous vaccination were found to be highlyneutralizing for all pseudovirus strains tested: Wuhan, Beta, Delta, and Omicron strains. The findings here, taken in consideration with the availability of both vaccines in thermostable formulations, support the testing of heterologousvaccination by an AAHI-SC2 > AdS+N regimen in animal models of SARS-CoV-2infection to assess its potential to provide increased protection againstemerging SARS-CoV-2 variants particularly in regions of the world where the need for cold-chain storage has limited the distribution of other vaccines.

AB  - A molecular mimicry between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) and human proteins supports the possibility that autoimmunity takes place during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contributing to tissue damage.For example, anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) have been reported in COVID-19 asa result of such mimicry and thought to contribute to the immunothrombosischaracteristic of the disease. Consistently, active immunization with the virusspike protein may elicit the production of cross-reactive autoantibodies,including aPL. We prospectively looked at the aPL production in healthcareworkers vaccinated with RNA- (BNT162b2, n. 100) or adenovirus-based vaccines(ChAdOx1, n. 50). Anti-cardiolipin, anti-beta2 glycoprotein I,anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM beforeand after vaccination were investigated. Anti-platelet factor 4 immunoglobulinswere also investigated as autoantibodies associated with COVID-19 vaccination.Additional organ (anti-thyroid) and non-organ (anti-nuclear) autoantibodies andIgG against human proteome were tested as further post-vaccination autoimmunitymarkers. The antibodies were tested one or three months after the first injectionof ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2, respectively; a 12-month clinical follow-up was alsoperformed. Vaccination occasionally induced low titers of aPL and otherautoantibodies but did not affect the titer of pre-existing autoantibodies. Nosignificant reactivities against a microarray of approximately 20,000 humanproteins were found in a subgroup of ChAdOx1-vaccinees. Consistently, we did not record any clinical manifestation theoretically associated with an underlyingautoimmune disorder. The data obtained after the vaccination (two doses for theRNA-based and one dose for the adenovirus-based vaccines), and the clinicalfollow-up are not supporting the occurrence of an early autoimmune response inthis cohort of healthcare workers.

AB  - Within the family Herpesviridae, sub-family beta-herpesvirinae, and genusRoseolovirus, there are only three human herpesviruses that have been described: HHV-6A, HHV-6B, and HHV-7. Initially, HHV-6A and HHV-6B were considered as twovariants of the same virus (i.e., HHV6). Despite high overall genetic sequenceidentity (~90%), HHV-6A and HHV-6B are now recognized as two distinct viruses.Sequence divergence (e.g., >30%) in key coding regions and significantdifferences in physiological and biochemical profiles (e.g., use of differentreceptors for viral entry) underscore the conclusion that HHV-6A and HHV-6B aredistinct viruses of the beta-herpesvirinae. Despite these viruses beingimplicated as causative agents in several nervous system disorders (e.g.,multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and chronic fatigue syndrome), the mechanisms ofaction and relative contributions of each virus to neurological dysfunction areunclear. Unresolved questions regarding differences in cell tropism, receptor useand binding affinity (i.e., CD46 versus CD134), host neuro-immunologicalresponses, and relative virulence between HHV-6A versus HHV-6B prevent a completecharacterization. Although it has been shown that both HHV-6A and HHV-6B caninfect glia (and, recently, cerebellar Purkinje cells), cell tropism of HHV-6Aversus HHV-6B for different nerve cell types remains vague. In this study, weshow that both viruses can infect different nerve cell types (i.e., glia versusneurons) and different neurotransmitter phenotypes derived from differentiatedhuman neural stem cells. As demonstrated by immunofluorescence, HHV-6A and HHV-6Bproductively infect VGluT1-containing cells (i.e., glutamatergic neurons) anddopamine-containing cells (i.e., dopaminergic neurons). However, neither virusappears to infect GAD67-containing cells (i.e., GABAergic neurons). As determinedby qPCR, expression of immunological factors (e.g., cytokines) in cells infected with HHV-6A versus HHV6-B also differs. These data along with morphometric andimage analyses of infected differentiated neural stem cell cultures indicate thatwhile HHV-6B may have greater opportunity for transmission, HHV-6A induces moresevere cytopathic effects (e.g., syncytia) at the same post-infection end points.Cumulatively, results suggest that HHV-6A is more virulent than HHV-6B insusceptible cells, while neither virus productively infects GABAergic cells.Consistency between these in vitro data and in vivo experiments would provide newinsights into potential mechanisms for HHV6-induced epileptogenesis.

AB  - An important number of studies have been conducted on the potential associationbetween human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and COVID-19 susceptibility andseverity since the beginning of the pandemic. However, case-control andpeptide-binding prediction methods tended to provide inconsistent conclusions on risk and protective HLA alleles, whereas some researchers suggested theimportance of considering the overall capacity of an individual's HLA Class Imolecules to present SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides. To close the gap between these approaches, we explored the distributions of HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 1st-fieldalleles in 142 Iranian patients with COVID-19 and 143 ethnically matched healthy controls, and applied in silico predictions of bound viral peptides for eachindividual's HLA molecules. Frequency comparison revealed the possiblepredisposing roles of HLA-A*03, B*35, and DRB1*16 alleles and the protectiveeffect of HLA-A*32, B*58, B*55, and DRB1*14 alleles in the viral infection. None of these results remained significant after multiple testing corrections, except HLA-A*03, and no allele was associated with severity, either. Compared to peptiderepertoires of individual HLA molecules that are more likely population-specific,the overall coverage of virus-derived peptides by one's HLA Class I moleculesseemed to be a more prominent factor associated with both COVID-19 susceptibilityand severity, which was independent of affinity index and threshold chosen,especially for people under 60 years old. Our results highlight the effect of thebinding capacity of different HLA Class I molecules as a whole, and the moreessential role of HLA-A compared to HLA-B and -C genes in immune responsesagainst SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Brief Research Report: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunity in Long Lasting Responders toCancer Immunotherapy Through mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccination.
PG  - 908108

AB  - Cancer patients (CPs) have been identified as particularly vulnerable toSARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore are a priority group for receiving COVID-19vaccination. From the patients with advanced solid tumors, about 20% respond veryefficiently to immunotherapy with anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies and achieve longlasting cancer responses. It is unclear whether an efficient cancer-specificimmune response may also correlate with an efficient response upon COVID-19vaccination. Here, we explored the antiviral immune response to the mRNA-basedCOVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 in a group of 11 long-lasting cancer immunotherapyresponders. We analysed the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG serumantibodies, virus neutralizing capacities and T cell responses. Control groupsincluded patients treated with adjuvant cancer immunotherapy (IMT, cohort B), CPsnot treated with immunotherapy (no-IMT, cohort C) and healthy controls (cohortA). The median ELISA IgG titers significantly increased after the prime-boostCOVID vaccine regimen in all cohorts (Cohort A: pre-vaccine = 900 (100-2700), 3weeks (w) post-boost = 24300 (2700-72900); Cohort B: pre-vaccine = 300(100-2700), 3 w post-boost = 8100 (300-72900); Cohort C: pre-vaccine = 500(100-2700), 3 w post-boost = 24300 (300-72900)). However, at the 3 w post-primetime-point, only the healthy control group showed a statistically significantincrease in antibody levels (Cohort A = 8100 (900-8100); Cohort B = 900(300-8100); Cohort C = 900 (300-8100)) (P < 0.05). Strikingly, while all healthy controls generated high-level antibody responses after the complete prime-boostregimen (Cohort A = 15/15 (100%), not all CPs behaved alike [Cohort B= 12/14(84'6%); Cohort C= 5/6 (83%)]. Their responses, including those of thelong-lasting immunotherapy responders, were more variable (Cohort A: 3 wpost-boost (median nAb titers = 95.32 (84.09-96.93), median Spike-specificIFN-gamma response = 64 (24-150); Cohort B: 3 w post-boost (median nAb titers =85.62 (8.22-97.19), median Spike-specific IFN-gamma response (28 (1-372); Cohort C: 3 w post-boost (median nAb titers = 95.87 (11.8-97.3), median Spike-specificIFN-gamma response = 67 (20-84)). Two long-lasting cancer responders did notrespond properly to the prime-boost vaccination and did not generate S-specificIgGs, neutralizing antibodies or virus-specific T cells, although their cancerimmune control persisted for years. Thus, although mRNA-based vaccines can induceboth antibody and T cell responses in CPs, the immune response to COVIDvaccination is independent of the capacity to develop an efficient anti-cancerimmune response to anti PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies.

AB  - Our understanding of the immune responses that follow SARS-CoV-2 infection andvaccination has progressed considerably since the COVID-19 pandemic was firstdeclared on the 11(th) of March in 2020. Recovery from infection is associatedwith the development of protective immune responses, although over time thesebecome less effective against new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Consequently,reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 variants is not infrequent and has contributed to theongoing pandemic. COVID-19 vaccines have had a tremendous impact on reducinginfection and particularly the number of deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2infection. However, waning of vaccine induced immunity plus the emergence of new variants has necessitated the use of boosters to maintain the benefits ofvaccination in reducing COVID-19 associated deaths. Boosting is also beneficialfor individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and developed natural immunity, also enhancing responses immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants. This reviewsummarizes our understanding of the immune responses that follow SARS-CoV-2infection and vaccination, the risks of reinfection with emerging variants andthe very important protective role vaccine boosting plays in both vaccinated and previously infected individuals.

AB  - The expression of type I interferons (IFNs) is one of the immediate hostresponses during most viral infections. The type I IFN family consists ofnumerous highly conserved IFNalpha subtypes, IFNbeta, and some others. Althoughthese IFNalpha subtypes were initially believed to act interchangeably, theirdiscrete biological properties are nowadays widely accepted. Subtype-specificantiviral, immunomodulatory, and anti-proliferative activities were reportedexplained by differences in receptor affinity, downstream signaling events, andindividual IFN-stimulated gene expression patterns. Type I IFNs and increased IFNsignatures potentially linked to hyperimmune activation of T cells are criticallydiscussed for chronic HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection. Here, weaimed to analyze the broad immunological effects of specific type I IFN subtypes (IFNalpha2, IFNalpha14, and IFNbeta) on T and NK cell subsets during HIV-1infection in vitro and ex vivo. Stimulation with IFNalpha14 and IFNbetasignificantly increased frequencies of degranulating (CD107a(+)) gut-derivedCD4(+) T cells and blood-derived T and NK cells. However, frequencies ofIFNgamma-expressing T cells were strongly reduced after stimulation withIFNalpha14 and IFNbeta. Phosphorylation of downstream molecules was not only IFN subtype-specific; also, significant differences in STAT5 phosphorylation wereobserved in both healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PBMCs of HIV-infected individuals, but this effect was less pronounced in healthygut-derived lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs), assuming cell and tissuespecific discrepancies. In conclusion, we observed distinct type I IFNsubtype-specific potencies in stimulating T and NK cell responses duringHIV-1-infection.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is still a major burden for global health despite effective vaccines. With the reduction of social distancing measures, infection rates are increasing in children, while data on the pediatric immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still lacking. Although the typical disease course in children has been mild, emerging variants may present new challenges in this age group. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 51 convalescent children, 24 seronegative siblings from early 2020, and 51 unexposed controls were stimulated withSARS-CoV-2-derived peptide MegaPools from the ancestral and beta variants. Flowcytometric determination of activation-induced markers and secreted cytokineswere used to quantify the CD4+ T cell response. The average time after infection was over 80 days. CD4+ T cell responses were detected in 61% of convalescentchildren and were markedly reduced in preschool children. Cross-reactive T cells for the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant were identified in 45% of cases after infectionwith an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variant. The CD4+ T cell response was accompaniedmost predominantly by IFN-gamma and Granzyme B secretion. An antiviral CD4+ Tcell response was present in children after ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, whichwas reduced in the youngest age group. We detected significant cross-reactivityof CD4+ T cell responses to the more recently evolved immune-escaping betavariant. Our findings have epidemiologic relevance for children regarding novelviral variants of concern and vaccination efforts.

AB  - Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly improves clinical outcomes and reduces mortality of infants/children living with HIV. However, the ability of infected cells to establish latent viral reservoirs shortly afterinfection and to persist during long-term ART remains a major barrier to cure. Inaddition, while early ART treatment of infants living with HIV can limit the sizeof the virus reservoir, it can also blunt HIV-specific immune responses and does not mediate clearance of latently infected viral reservoirs. Thus, adjunctiveimmune-based therapies that are geared towards limiting the establishment of the virus reservoir and/or mediating the clearance of persistent reservoirs are ofinterest for their potential to achieve viral remission in the setting ofpediatric HIV. Because of the differences between the early life and adult immunesystems, these interventions may need to be tailored to the pediatric settings.Understanding the attributes and specificities of the early life immune milieuthat are likely to impact the virus reservoir is important to guide thedevelopment of pediatric-specific immune-based interventions towards viralremission and cure. In this review, we compare the immune profiles of pediatricand adult HIV elite controllers, discuss the characteristics of cellular andanatomic HIV reservoirs in pediatric populations, and highlight the potentialvalues of current cure strategies using immune-based therapies for long-termviral remission in the absence of ART in children living with HIV.

AB  - Immunotherapy is one of the promising strategies in the treatment of oncology.Immune checkpoint inhibitors, as a type of immunotherapy, have no significantefficacy in the clinical treatment of patients with pMMR/MSS/MSI-L mCRC alone.Therefore, there is an urgent need to find combination therapies that can improvethe response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Oncolytic viruses are a newclass of cancer drugs that, in addition to directly lysing tumor cells, canfacilitate the action of immune checkpoint inhibitors by modulating the tumormicroenvironment and transforming "cold" tumors into "hot" ones. The combination of oncolytic viruses and immune checkpoint inhibitors is currently being used in several primary and clinical studies to treat tumors with exciting results. Thecombination of genetically modified "armed" OV with ICIs is expected to be one ofthe treatment options for pMMR/MSS/MSI-L mCRC. In this paper, we will analyze thecurrent status of oncolytic viruses and ICIs available for the treatment of CRC. The feasibility of OV in combination with ICI for CRC will be discussed in terms of the mechanism of action of OV in treating tumors.

AB  - Objectives: Human T leukemia virus type one (HTLV-1) causes two life-threatening diseases in around five percent of infected subjects, a T cell malignancy and aneurodegenerative disease. TAX and HBZ are the main virulence agents implicatedin the manifestation of HTLV-1-associated diseases. Therefore, this study aims toproduce these HTLV-1 factors as recombinant Fc fusion proteins to study thestructures, their immunogenic properties as vaccines, and their capability toproduce specific neutralization antibodies. Materials and Methods: TAX and HBZsequences were chosen from the NCBI-nucleotide database, then designed as humanFc chimers and cloned into Pichia pastoris. Produced proteins were purified byHiTrap affinity chromatography and subcutaneously injected into rabbits. RabbitAbs were purified by batch chromatography, and their neutralization activitiesfor the HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cell line were assessed. Furthermore, the protectiveabilities of recombinant proteins were evaluated in Tax or HBZ immunized rabbits by MT-2 cell line inoculation and measurement of HTLV-1-proviral load. Results:Specific Abs against Tax and HBZ can eliminate 2 million MT-2 cells in 1/1000dilution in vitro. In challenging assays, the immunization of the animals usingTax or HBZ had no protective activity as HTLV-1 PVL was still positive.Conclusion: The result suggests that recombinant TAX and HBZ: hFcgamma1 proteins can produce a proper humoral immune response. Therefore, they could be considereda passive immunotherapy source for HTLV-1-associated diseases, while total TAXand HBZ proteins are unsuitable as HTLV-1 vaccine candidates.

AB  - Objectives: SARS-CoV-2, emerging as a major threat to public health, has to becontrolled through vaccination. Naloxone (NLX), an opioid receptor antagonist,demonstrated its adjuvant activity for microbial vaccines. In this study,inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was developed in the Alum/NLX adjuvant to increase thepotency of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Materials and Methods: BALB/c micewere immunized on days 0 and 14 with inactivated SARS-CoV-2-Alum, -Alum + NLX 3mg/kg, -Alum + NLX 10 mg/kg, and -Freund adjuvant, as well as PBS. IFN-gamma and IL-4 cytokines and Granzyme-B release were assessed with ELISA. In addition,specific total IgG, IgG1/IgG2a isotypes, and ratio as well as anti-RBD IgGresponses were assessed with an optimized ELISA. Results: SARS-CoV-2-Alum-NLX10group showed a significant increase in the IFN-gamma cytokine response versusSARS-CoV-2-Alum, SARS-CoV-2-Alum-NLX3, and PBS groups. The SARS-CoV-2-Alum-NLX3group exhibited a significant decrease in IL-4 cytokine versus SARS-CoV-2-Alum.The mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2-Alum-NLX10 showed a significant increase inCTL activity versus SARS-CoV-2-Alum and PBS. In addition, mice immunized withSARS-CoV-2-Alum-NLX3, SARS-CoV-2-Alum-NLX10 and SARS-CoV-2-Freund demonstrated anincrease in IgG response, as compared with SARS-CoV-2-Alum and PBS group.Furthermore, all formulations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines could induce both IgG1 andIgG2a isotypes. But, the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio in SARS-CoV-2-Freund andSARS-CoV-2-Alum-NLX10 revealed an increase as compared with that of theSARS-CoV-2-Alum group. Anti-RBD IgG response in the SARS-CoV-2-Alum-NLX10 groupshowed a significant increase as compared with the Alum-based vaccine.Conclusion: Formulation of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in NLX/alum adjuvantimproved the potency of humoral and, especially, cellular responses.

LID - 10.1016/j.cclet.2022.07.044 [doi]
AB  - The SARSCoV2 virus is released from an infectious source (such as a sick person) and adsorbed on aerosols, which can form pathogenic microorganism aerosols, whichcan affect human health through airborne transmission. Efficient sampling andaccurate detection of microorganisms in aerosols are the premise and basis forstudying their properties and evaluating their hazard. In this study, we built a set of sub-micron aerosol detection platform, and carried out a simulationexperiment on the SARSCoV2 aerosol in the air by wet-wall cyclone combined withimmunomagnetic nanoparticle adsorption sampling and ddPCR. The feasibility of thesystem in aerosol detection was verified, and the influencing factors in thedetection process were experimentally tested. As a result, the samplingefficiency was 29.77%, and extraction efficiency was 98.57%. The minimumdetection limit per unit volume of aerosols was 250 copies (10(2) copies/mL,concentration factor 2.5).

TI  - Probing a Stochastic Epidemic Hepatitis C Virus Model with a Chronically InfectedTreated Population.
PG  - 2087-2112
LID - 10.1007/s10473-022-0521-1 [doi]
AB  - The hepatitis C virus is hitherto a tremendous threat to human beings, but manyresearchers have analyzed mathematical models for hepatitis C virus transmission dynamics only in the deterministic case. Stochasticity plays an immense role inpathology and epidemiology. Hence, the main theme of this article is toinvestigate a stochastic epidemic hepatitis C virus model with five states ofepidemiological classification: susceptible, acutely infected, chronicallyinfected, recovered or removed and chronically infected, and treated. Thestochastic hepatitis C virus model in epidemiology is established based on theenvironmental influence on individuals, is manifested by stochasticperturbations, and is proportional to each state. We assert that the stochasticHCV model has a unique global positive solution and attains sufficient conditionsfor the extinction of the hepatotropic RNA virus. Furthermore, by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, we obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of an ergodic stationary distribution of the solutions to the stochastic HCV model. Moreover, this article confirms that using numerical simulations, the sixparameters of the stochastic HCV model can have a high impact over the diseasetransmission dynamics, specifically the disease transmission rate, the rate ofchronically infected population, the rate of progression to chronic infection,the treatment failure rate of chronically infected population, the recovery rate from chronic infection and the treatment rate of the chronically infectedpopulation. Eventually, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of ourtheoretical conclusions.

PG  - 132427
LID - 10.1016/j.snb.2022.132427 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the cellsthrough the binding of spike protein to the host cell surface-expressingangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or by endocytosis mediated byextracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (CD147). We present extendedstatistical studies of the multisine dynamic electrochemical impedancespectroscopy (DEIS) revealing interactions between Spike RBD and cellularreceptors ACE2 and CD147, and a reference anti-RBD antibody (IgG2B) based on afunctionalised boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode. The DEIS was supported by amultivariate data analysis of a SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD assay and cross-correlatedwith the atomic-level information revealed by molecular dynamics simulations.This approach allowed us to study and detect subtle changes in the electricalproperties responsible for the susceptibility of cellular receptors toSARS-CoV-2, revealing their interactions. Changes in electrical homogeneity inthe function of the RBD concentration led to the conclusion that the ACE2receptor delivers the most homogeneous surface, delivered by the highelectrostatic potential of the relevant docking regions. For higher RBDconcentrations, the differences in electrical homogeneity between electrodes withdifferent receptors vanish. Collectively, this study reveals interdependent virusentry pathways involving separately ACE2, CD147, and spike protein, as assessedusing a biosensing platform for the rapid screening of cellular interactions(i.e. testing various mutations of SARS-CoV-2 or screening of therapeutic drugs).

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection remains spread worldwide and requires a better understandingof virus-host interactions. Here, we analyzed biochemical modifications due toSARS-CoV-2 infection in cells by confocal Raman microscopy. Obtained results werecompared with the infection with another RNA virus, the measles virus. Ourresults have demonstrated a virus-specific Raman molecular signature, reflecting intracellular modification during each infection. Advanced data analysis has beenused to distinguish non-infected versus infected cells for two RNA viruses.Further, classification between non-infected and SARS-CoV-2 and measlesvirus-infected cells yielded an accuracy of 98.9 and 97.2 respectively, with asignificant increase of the essential amino-acid tryptophan inSARS-CoV-2-infected cells. These results present proof of concept for theapplication of Raman spectroscopy to study virus-host interaction and to identifyfactors that contribute to the efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection and may thusprovide novel insights on viral pathogenesis, targets of therapeutic interventionand development of new COVID-19 biomarkers.

AB  - Currently, the incorporation of multiple epitopes into vaccines is more desirablethan the incorporation of a single antigen for universal influenza vaccinedevelopment. However, epitopes induce poor immune responses. Although the use of adjuvants can overcome this obstacle, it may raise new problems. Effectiveantigen delivery vehicles that can function as both antigen carriers andintrinsic adjuvants are highly desired for vaccine development. Here, we report abiepitope nanovaccine that provides complete protection in mice against H3N2virus as well as partial protection against H1N1 virus. This vaccine (3MCD-f)consists of two conserved epitopes (matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) andCDhelix), and these epitopes were presented on the surface of ferritin in asequential tandem format. Subcutaneous immunization with 3MCD-f in the absence ofadjuvant induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses. These resultsprovide a proof of concept for the 3MCD-f nanovaccine that might be an idealcandidate for future influenza pandemics.

AB  - Governments across the world have integrated a variety of advanced technologiesto respond to the COVID-19 crisis. In particular, the use of surveillanceprograms that leverage data and tools from mobile phones have become importantcomponents of public health strategies to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 acrossthe globe. Currently, big technology companies around the world are helpinggovernments evaluate the effectiveness of their social distancing protocols byexamining and analyzing movements of millions of mobile phone users in order todetermine how the virus is spreading across the various geographic locations, andthe effectiveness of the various social distancing methods that have beenimplemented. The collection and use of individual mobile phone data as a publichealth surveillance tool presents tensions between several ethical priorities.Such a dilemma resides in the tensions between public health ethics goals andclinical ethics goals. While public health ethics pursues goals that seek toensure the good of the community, such goals are often achieved at the expense ofclinical ethics goals which emphasize individual autonomy and civil liberty. Inusing persons' mobile phone data as a tool to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, wemust address the tensions associated with weighing the needs of "the many" withensuring the rights of the individual.

AB  - Successful sequencing of the human genome and evolving functional knowledge ofgene products has taken genomic medicine to the forefront, soon combining broadlywith traditional diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognostics in patients. Recentyears have witnessed an extraordinary leap in our understanding of oculardiseases and their respective genetic underpinnings. As we are entering the ageof genomic medicine, rapid advances in genome sequencing, gene delivery, genomesurgery, and computational genomics enable an ever-increasing capacity to providea precise and robust diagnosis of diseases and the development of targetedtreatment strategies. Inherited retinal diseases are a major source of blindness around the world where a large number of causative genes have been identified,paving the way for personalized diagnostics in the clinic. Developments infunctional genetics and gene transfer techniques has also led to the first FDAapproval of gene therapy for LCA, a childhood blindness. Many such retinaldiseases are the focus of various clinical trials, making clinical diagnoses ofretinal diseases, their underlying genetics and the studies of natural historyimportant. Here, we review methodologies for identifying new genes and variantsassociated with various ocular disorders and the complexities associated withthem. Thereafter we discuss briefly, various retinal diseases and the applicationof genomic technologies in their diagnosis. We also discuss the strategies,challenges, and potential of gene therapy for the treatment of inherited andacquired retinal diseases. Additionally, we discuss the translational aspects of gene therapy, the important vector types and considerations for human trials thatmay help advance personalized therapeutics in ophthalmology. Retinal diseaseresearch has led the application of precision diagnostics and precisiontherapies; therefore, this review provides a general understanding of the currentstatus of precision medicine in ophthalmology.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Non-invasive Model to Predict Liver Histological Lesions in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients With Persistently Normal AlanineAminotransferase and Detectable Viremia.
PG  - 944547
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.944547 [doi]
AB  - Background: A critical and controversial issue is whether antiviral therapyshould be recommended in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection patients with persistently normal alanine aminotransferase (PNALT) and detectable HBV DNA. The study aimed to develop a non-invasive model for predicting significant liverhistological changes (SLHC), which is the histological indication for antiviraltherapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with PNALT and detectable HBV DNA. Methods: 398 chronic HBV infection patients with PNALT and detectable HBV DNA whounderwent liver biopsy were divided into the estimation set (n = 256) andvalidation set (n = 142). A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to predict SLHC in the estimation set, and the diagnostic performance was furthervalidated in the validation set. Results: 132 patients (33.2%) with PNALT anddetectable HBV DNA had SLHC. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholinesterase(ChE), and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) were identified as the independentpredictors of SLHC. The AUROC of the SLHC index, which combined AST, ChE, andLSM, was 0.824 and 0.816 in the estimation and validation set, respectively, for the prediction of SLHC. Applying the SLHC index </= 0.15, the presence of SLHCcould be excluded with high negative predictive value in the estimation set(93.2%) and in the validation set (90.2%). Applying the SLHC index >/= 0.55, the presence of SLHC could be considered with high positive predictive value in theestimation set (79.2%) and in the validation set (76.5%). Conclusion: The SLHCindex provides a high accuracy in predicting liver histological indication forantiviral therapy in CHB patients with PNALT and detectable HBV DNA.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily affects the respiratory tract, but also many other organs and tissues, leading to different pathological pictures,such as those of the musculoskeletal tissues. The present study should beconsidered as a speculation on the relationship between COVID-19 infection andsome frequent musculoskeletal pathologies, in particular sarcopenia, boneloss/osteoporosis (OP) and fracture risk and osteoarthritis (OA), to hypothesize how the virus acts on these pathologies and consequently on the tissueregeneration/healing potential. The study focuses in particular on the modalitiesof interaction of COVID-19 with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on the"cytokine storm." Knowing the effects of COVID-19 on musculoskeletal tissuescould be important also to understand if tissue regenerative/reparative capacity is compromised, especially in elderly and frail patients. We speculate that ACE2 and serine proteases together with an intense inflammation, immobilization andmalnutrition could be the responsible for muscle weakness, altered boneremodeling, increase in bone fracture risk and inflammatory joint pathologies.Future preclinical and clinical studies may focus on the regenerative/reparative properties of the musculoskeletal tissues after COVID-19 infection, toward apersonalized treatment usually based on scaffolds, cells, and growth factors.

AB  - Starting from the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndromeCoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, most of the published data hasconcentrated on the respiratory signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection,underestimating the presence and importance of ocular manifestations, such asconjunctivitis, usually reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. With thepresent review we intend to resume the ocular involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infectionand the recent discoveries about the different cell types and tissues of the eye that can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and propagate the infection.Moreover, reviewing literature data about p53 expression in normal and diseasedeye tissues, we hypothesize that the pleiotropic protein p53 present at highlevels in cornea, conjunctiva and tear film might play a protective role against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since p53 can be easily up-regulated by using smallmolecule non-genotoxic inhibitors of MDM2, we propose that topical use ofNutlin-3, the prototype member of MDM2 inhibitors, might protect the anteriorsurface of the eye from SARS-CoV-2 infection, reducing the spreading of thevirus.

PG  - 875910
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.875910 [doi]
AB  - We reviewed the available information on the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in populations with special conditions, namely, patients with HIV,tuberculosis, or underlying autoimmune disease. Available data show thattreatment with ICIs is safe in patients with HIV; it is advisable, however, that these patients receive adequate antiretroviral therapy and have an undetectableviral load before ICIs are initiated. Tuberculosis reactivation has been reportedwith the use of ICIs, possibly due to immune dysregulation. Tuberculosis has alsobeen associated with the use of immunosuppressors to treat immune-related adverseevents (irAEs). Active tuberculosis must be ruled out in patients with symptomsor signs, and selected patients may benefit from screening for latenttuberculosis infection, although more data are required. Limited data existregarding the safety of ICIs in patients with cancer and autoimmune disease. Datafrom observational studies suggest that up to 29% of patients with a preexisting autoimmune disease treated with an ICI present with an autoimmune disease flare, and 30% present with a de novo irAE of any type. The frequency of flares appears to differ according to the type of ICI received, with higher rates associatedwith PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The most common autoimmune diseases for whichpatients reported flares with ICI therapy are rheumatoid arthritis, otherinflammatory arthritis, and psoriasis. Most studies have reported flares or denovo irAEs associated with ICIs that were mild to moderate, with low rates ofdiscontinuation and no deaths due to flares. Therefore, the use of ICIs in these patients is possible, but careful monitoring is required.

AB  - We present a 51-year-old male, with a past medical history of type 2insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (T2IDDM) without neuropathy, coronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19) in April 2020 without residual symptoms, Raynaud's, andrecent occupational outdoor exposure to insects as a construction manager whocame to the emergency room complaining of a three-week history of bilateralprogressive numbness and weakness beginning in his lower extremities andascending toward his pelvis. Notably, he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine one week prior to symptom onset and four weeks prior toadmission. He also reported a recent appearance of a maculopapular rash on hisupper extremities and flanks. Physical exam was remarkable for bilateral distalmotor weakness in the upper and lower extremities with associated paresthesia anddecreased reflexes in the lower extremities. The patient had slight ataxia anddifficulty with heel walk and toe walk. Notably, the cranial nerve exam wasnormal, and the patient was afebrile. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) wasstarted empirically for the treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), anddoxycycline 100mg intravenous twice a day and ceftriaxone 2g intravenous dailywere started for possible tick-borne disease. Subsequently, rapid plasma reagin(RPR) returned reactive at 1:64, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) venereal diseaseresearch laboratory (VDRL) test was reactive at 1:2 with markedly elevatedprotein and pleocytosis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was negative.Lyme disease testing was negative. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) andelectromyography (EMG) showed a sensorimotor polyneuropathy with mixeddemyelinating and axonal features. IVIG was continued for a total of five days,and antibiotics were changed to penicillin G (PCN G) for a total of 14 days fordefinitive treatment of early neurosyphilis (NS). While both clinical andlaboratory findings confirm a positive diagnosis of NS, the patient's CSFcomposition showed very elevated total protein levels and pleocytosis.Additionally, his early peripheral neuropathy and EMG findings are notcharacteristics of a single disease and, instead, suggested a mixed pathology. Wepostulate that this patient had confirmed secondary syphilis with early NSassociated with, and possibly correlated with, a simultaneous episode of acuteinflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and/or a vaccine-relatedphenomenon.

PG  - e26264
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26264 [doi]
AB  - The West Nile virus (WNV) belongs to the genus of flaviviruses and is known tocause irreversible neurologic deficits. Neuroinvasive WNV cases continue to berare and have a higher prevalence in South America, Africa, and Asia. Here wereport a 55-year-old female from North America who presented with acute-onsetencephalopathy, fever, myalgias, and Anton syndrome. Neuroradiographic findingsincluded diffuse white matter abnormalities of both cortical and subcorticalstructures and the patient was diagnosed with posterior reversible encephalopathysyndrome (PRES). Further workup revealed WNV antibodies in both cerebrospinalfluid (CSF) and serum. Management of WNV encephalitis continues to be poor andthus the patient was referred to a long-term care facility. Furthermore, Antonsyndrome is a rare focal neurologic deficit that has never been previouslyassociated with the WNV. This case aims to highlight the epidemiology of WNV inthe United States, the mechanisms of WNV encephalitis, and an overview of Antonsyndrome.

PG  - e26394
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26394 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) infectiousdisease pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. The firstdocumented case in Saudi Arabia was on March 2, 2020. Soon after, the WorldHealth Organization declared the outbreak a global pandemic. The ministry ofhealth in Saudi Arabia mandated the wearing of facial masks for the generalpopulation, among other methods of protection from the spread of this highlycontagious virus. It was observed that the continuous and prolonged wearing offacial masks has led to the development of multiple skin complications and facialdermatosis, including new-onset acne as well as flares of pre-existing acne inthe general population and especially healthcare workers. METHODOLOGY: Thiscross-sectional study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic from January to September 2021 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A self-administered electronic survey wasdistributed to residents of Jeddah city using multiple social media platforms to assess the prevalence and the factors attributed to the development ofmask-induced acne. RESULT: A total of 630 participants were enrolled. 470 (74.6%)were females and 160 (25.4%) were males, and the predominant age group was 18-30 years old, 374 (59.4%). The majority of participants wore a mask for five toseven days per week, 272 (43.2%), and for less than four hours per day, 378(60%). The surgical masks were the most frequently used masks, with 597 (94.8%). Three hundred and seventy-nine (60.2%) participants had no previous skin disease on their faces. Only 251 (39.8%) of the participants had pre-existing skindiseases affecting the face. Of those, acne was the most frequent skin condition,217 (86.4%), followed by atopic dermatitis, 12 (4.8%). Ninety-seven (23.5%)participants without a prior history of acne reported the new onset of acneduring the pandemic with the use of a face mask or face shield. Thirty people(59.9%) who had acne on their faces before the pandemic said that their acne got worse when they wore face masks or face shields for a long time during thepandemic. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a significant association betweenthe new onset of acne or worsening of pre-existing acne and the frequent andprolonged usage of facial masks. Thus, certain measures should be applied toprevent the development of new or worsening of prior acne while maintainingeffective protection using facial masks.

TI  - Patient Experiences With a Remote Monitoring Pathway for COVID-19.
PG  - e26263
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26263 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a remotemonitoring pathway was developed at Michael Garron Hospital to allow individuals with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 infection to successfully manage theirillness at home. This study aims to understand patients' experiences on thisremote monitoring pathway and to investigate the effectiveness of the pathway in preventing unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits and detecting severeinfection. METHODS: A total of 35 semi-structured interviews were conducted over the phone. Researchers reviewed transcripts to come up with an index of nodes.Two researchers initially coded the same four transcripts to ensure highinter-rater reliability. The remaining 31 transcripts were coded by oneresearcher. RESULTS: Of patients, 80% (n = 28) had a positive experience on thepathway. Remote monitoring was effective in reassuring 22.9% of patients (n = 8) with mild-moderate symptoms that their symptoms were not significant enough to goto the ED and they were monitored at home. A total of 8.6% of patients (n = 3)were correctly identified as having severe symptoms while on the pathway and wereasked to present to the hospital. For 8.6% of patients (n = 3), remote monitoringdid not identify their severe COVID-19 illness. Of patients, 2.9% (n = 1) wereincorrectly identified as having severe COVID-19 symptoms when they wereclinically well. DISCUSSION: Remote monitoring is an effective tool to optimizehealthcare resources during a pandemic. It reduces ER visits and provides a meansfor routine follow-up while minimizing virus exposure. Patients generally had apositive experience; however, more research needs to be done on optimizing thedetection of severe infection.

TI  - Perspectives on COVID-19 Vaccines and Its Hesitancy Among Jordanian Population.
PG  - e26337
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26337 [doi]
AB  - Background Since the spread of the COVID-19 virus, governments are puttingsignificant resources into ending the pandemic. Vaccination arises as the bestsolution to get back to our everyday lives. However, we are now facing vaccinehesitancy, which is a critical problem. Methods This cross-sectional study wasconducted between December 15, 2020, and March 1, 2021, using a validatedonline-based questionnaire; participants were compared using the StatisticalPackage for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program based on multiple factors. ResultsA total of 1607 participants throughout Jordan have responded to thequestionnaire, among which 880 (54.8%) have bachelor's degrees, 236 (14.7%) have a high educational level (master and doctoral), and 491 (30.5%) have a diploma orless. Although this is a non-probable sample, it is not a representative sampleas, according to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), only 33.6% of the Jordan population have a tertiary education. Overall,892 (55.5%) of the studied subjects had the intention to take the vaccine,distributed as follows: 156 (66.1%) of the high educational participants wantedto take the vaccine, compared to 512 (58.2%) of those who have bachelor's degree and 224 (45.6%) of those who have diploma or less (p < 0.001). Reading scientificarticles talking about the vaccines and their effects (55.6%, p < 0.001), knowingthe mechanism of action (45.2%, p = 0.007), getting proper medical advice (27.2%,p < 0.001), encouraged by the increasing number of infections and deaths (39.7%, p < 0.001), and the number of people who received the vaccine (16.1%, p < 0.001) were the most critical factors that played a role in taking the vaccine by all ofthe studied groups. Male gender (OR = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.54-2.64; p < 0.001), high income of more than 1000 JDs (1400 USD) (OR = 3.23; 95% CI = 2.21-4.71; p <0.001), having an educational level of either high education (OR = 3.39; 95% CI =2.07-5.55; p < 0.001) or bachelor degree (OR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.25-2.24; p =0.001), and being encouraged by the increasing number of infections and deathscaused by COVID-19 (OR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.46-2.66; p < 0.001) were allsignificantly associated with the willingness to take the vaccine. Conclusion As the world rushes toward vaccination to end the pandemic, efforts are needed toend this phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy by enlightening people with the precise knowledge regarding the vaccine's mechanism of action, side effects, and efficacyfocusing mainly on people with lower educational levels.

AB  - We describe a case of acute-onset worsening of a patient's previouslywell-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) following his recovery from anovel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A78-year-old male with a three-year medical history of well-controlled T2DM(controlled by diet and metformin) presented to the outpatient clinic to discuss his regularly scheduled six-month lab work. He mentioned having a mildcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection lasting one week which required no medical treatment approximately two months before his current visit. His labs,taken one week prior to his current visit, were notable for fastinghyperglycemia, 301mg/dL, and an elevated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), 11%. A fastingblood glucose level was recorded at his current in-office visit and was found to be 403mg/dL. These findings were not anticipated - our patient reported no changein his meals, medications, or exercise routines. The only notable change hereported between visits was his COVID-19 infection. This case report explores thelink between this virus and our patient's exacerbation of his previouslywell-controlled T2DM. Whether it be through insulin resistance or deficiency (or another unknown mechanism), our patient's prior novel COVID-19 infection couldpotentially be associated with his unprecedented altered glucose metabolism.

PG  - e26371
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26371 [doi]
AB  - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare disease characterized byautoantibodies directed at red blood cells. Patients typically present withanemia and are diagnosed by positive direct antiglobulin (DAT) test. AIHA issubclassified into warm or cold based on antibodies involved and depending ontheir optimal temperature in which they react with RBC antigens. Warm AIHA can beeither primary (idiopathic) or secondary depending on etiology. Secondary causes are associated with malignancy, connective tissue and inflammatory diseases,infections (typically viral infections), or drugs (e.g., antibiotics,chemotherapeutic agents). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus that iscommonly associated with cold AIHA, with only one reported case of EBV-inducedwarm AIHA. It has been postulated that antibodies against EBV cross-react withantigens expressed on RBC membranes and activate the complement cascadesimilarly. This case report describes a case of a 32-year-old male who presented with warm AIHA secondary to EBV reinfection.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is classified as a herpesvirus and is known for beingone of the few viruses that can lead to the development of cancer. This study hasgathered several studies to provide evidence as to this association as well assome of the mechanisms specific to EBV that allow this to happen. The developmentof EBV into cancer as well as the proteins involved in this oncogenesis play acrucial role in understanding this problem as well as creating a solution formitigating this disease process in the future. This study summarized three of themost common malignancies caused by EBV in order to consolidate information about each of them. Additional emphasis was placed on finding which EBV serum markerswere seen to be most indicative of prognosis and likelihood of developingmalignancy. Higher serum EBV viral DNA loads were seen to be a useful indicatorin assessing the risk of various cancers and should be studied further inrelation to cancers that were not mentioned in this review.

PG  - e26186
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26186 [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of thenervous system with incredibly intricate etiopathogenesis involving numerousgenetic, epigenetic, and environmental risk factors. Major environmental riskfactors include ultraviolet (UV) radiation, vitamin D, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)infection, smoking, and high body mass index (BMI). Vitamin D, in particular, canbe viewed as one piece of this puzzle, with various tabs and pockets, occupying asequential site. In this article, we have briefly discussed the neuroimmunologyof MS and the role of vitamin D in regulating immune responses. Variousobservational studies and clinical trials were reviewed and discussed accordingto stages of disease activity and course of the disease. The data reviewed inthis article implied that serum vitamin D levels greatly influence the risk ofdeveloping MS and disease activity. Long-term follow-up studies indicated thatlow serum vitamin D levels correlate with worse disability outcomes. Sinceclinical trials did not provide significant evidence, the role of vitamin D incontrolling disease activity remains unresolved. Larger clinical trials areneeded to support the findings of observational studies and provide significantevidence in favour of vitamin D.

PG  - 5643345
LID - 10.1155/2022/5643345 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Forsythia suspensa leaf (FSL) has been used as a health tea in Chinafor centuries. Previous experiments have proved that FSL extract has a goodeffect on the antirespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vitro, but its exactmechanism is not clear. Therefore, this study aims to determine the activecomponents and targets of FSL and further explore its anti-RSV mechanism.Methods: UPLC-Q-Exactive-MS was used to analyze the main chemical components ofFSL. The compound disease target network, PPI, GO, and KEGG were used to obtainkey targets and potential ways. Then, the molecular docking was verified bySchrodinger Maestro software. Next, the cell model of RSV infection wasestablished, and the inhibitory effect of each drug on RSV was detected. Finally,western blotting was used to detect the effect of the active components of FSL onthe expression of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related protein. Results:UPLC-Q-Exactive-MS analysis showed that there were 67 main chemical constituents in FSL, while network pharmacological analysis showed that there were 169anti-RSV targets of the active components in FSL, involving 177 signal pathways, among which PI3K/AKT signal pathway played an important role in the anti-RSVprocess of FSL. The results of molecular docking showed that cryptochlorogenicacid, phillyrin, phillygenin, rutin, and rosmarinic acid had higher bindingactivities to TP53, STAT3, MAPK1, AKT1, and MAPK3, respectively. In vitroexperiments showed that phillyrin and rosmarinic acid could effectively improvethe survival rate of RSV-infected cells, increase the expression level of PI3K,and decrease the expression level of AKT. Conclusion: The active ingredients ofFSL, phillyrin, and rosmarinic acid can play an anti-RSV role by inhibitingPI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This study provides reliable theoretical andexperimental support for the anti-RSV treatment of FSL.

TI  - Antimicrobial Alkaloids from Marine-Derived Fungi as Drug Leads versus COVID-19Infection: A Computational Approach to Explore their Anti-COVID-19 Activity andADMET Properties.
PG  - 5403757
LID - 10.1155/2022/5403757 [doi]
AB  - Therapeutic strategies based upon enzyme inhibition have recently gained higherattention in treating hazardous ailments. Herein, the potential use ofseventy-two antimicrobial alkaloids isolated from marine-derived fungi to fightCOVID-19 infection via inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 lethal virus was performed using in silico analyses. Molecular modelling was performed to assess their enzymeinhibitory potential on the main protease SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro), 3-chymotrypsin-like protease SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro), and papain-like protease SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) usingDiscovery Studio 4.5. Validation of the docking experiments was done bydetermination of RMSD (root mean square deviation) after redocking thesuperimposition of the cocrystalized ligands. Results showed that gymnastatin Z(72) showed the best fitting score in SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro) and SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pr)active sites with G equal -34.15 and -34.28 Kcal/mol, respectively. Meanwhile,scalusamide C (62) displayed the highest fitting within SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) activesites (G = -26.91 Kcal/mol) followed by eutypellazine M (57). ADMET/TOPKATprediction displayed that eutypellazine M and scalusamide C showed betterpharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Gymnastatin Z is safer showingbetter toxicity criteria and higher rat oral LD50 and rat chronic LOAEL (lowestobserved adverse effect level). Chemometric analysis using principle componentanalysis (PCA) based on the binding energies observed for the compounds withrespect to the three tested enzymes revealed the clustering of the compounds intodifferent clusters. Eutypellazine M, scalusamide C, and gymnastatin Z appear inone cluster due to their closeness in activity. Thus, these compounds could serveas promising SARS-CoV-2 enzymes inhibitors that could help in alleviation ofCOVID-19 infection. Further investigations are recommended to confirm the resultsof molecular modelling.

AB  - Aim: To compare the clinical characteristics of acute pancreatitis (AP) andrecurrent acute pancreatitis (ARP) in children. Method: From January 2011 toJanuary 2021, a total of 275 pediatric patients with AP admitted to a tertiaryteaching hospital were enrolled. Results: The median age of 275 children was 12.0years. Among them, 55 cases were ARP. The leading causes of pediatricpancreatitis were biliary tract and virus infection. The percent of male in theAP group was higher than that in the ARP group. Viral infection in the AP groupwere higher than that in the ARP group, but anatomical abnormalities were lowerthan those in the ARP group. The incidence of pancreatic pseudocysts in the ARPgroup was higher than that in the AP group. The median interval time from AP toARP was 3.0 months. Conclusion: The main causes of pediatric pancreatitis werebiliary tract and virus infection in the study. AP caused by virus infectionseems to be less likely to develop into ARP. Female and anatomical abnormalityare risks of ARP. Children with ARP are more likely to be complicated withpancreatic pseudocyst. There was no difference in ICU admission or mortalitybetween AP and ARP.

PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1007/s40675-022-00226-5 [doi]
AB  - Purpose of review: Central nervous system (CNS) hypersomnias can be triggered by external factors, such as infection or as a response to vaccination. The 2019coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which was caused by severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), led to a worldwide effort toquickly develop a vaccine to contain the pandemic and reduce morbidity andmortality. This narrative review is focused on the literature published in thepast 2 years and provides an update on current knowledge in respect of thetriggering of CNS hypersomnias by infection per se, vaccination, and circadianrhythm alterations caused by social isolation, lockdown, and quarantine. Recentfindings: At present, there is no consensus on the association betweenhypersomnias and COVID-19 vaccination or infection per se; however, the datasuggest that there has been an increase in excessive daytime sleepiness due tovaccination, but only for a short duration. Kleine Levin syndrome, hypersomnia,excessive daytime sleepiness, and narcolepsy were aggravated and exacerbated insome case reports in the literature. Both increased and decreased sleep duration and improved and worsened sleep quality were described. In all age groups,delayed sleep time was frequent in studies of patients with hypersomnolence.Summary: The hypothesis that there is a pathophysiological mechanism by which thevirus, vaccination, and the effects of quarantine aggravate hypersomnias isdiscussed in this review.

PG  - 924913
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.924913 [doi]
AB  - Introduction/Background: HealthCare worker (HCW) mental health and wellbeing are uniquely affected by the complexities of COVID-19 due to exposure to the virus,isolation from family and friends, risk and uncertainty. Little if any inquiryhas examined the effects on an entire healthcare system, particularly immediatelypost-surge. We sought to examine the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms andbehavioral health difficulties as a healthcare system transitioned out of thefirst wave. We assessed the effects of work role, setting and individualdiversity factors on employee distress and coping strategies. Materials andMethods: This was an Institutional Review Board approved, unfunded, voluntarysurvey sent via REDCap link, to all employees of Hartford HealthCare, a mid-sizedhealthcare system (N approximately 29,900) between May 15th and June 26th, 2020. Two system-wide emails and two emails targeting managers were sent during thistime frame. Eight thousand four hundred and ninety four employees (28.4% of alle-mails distributed) participated in the survey, representing clinical, support, administrative, and medical staff across hospital, outpatient, residential, andbusiness settings. The survey contained items assessing personal background, workenvironment/culture, and formal measures, including: patient healthquestionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), general anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), primary carepost-traumatic stress disorder screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD), alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT-C), and the insomnia severity index (ISI). Results:Almost 1/3 of respondents (31%) reported symptoms of clinically significantanxiety; 83% moderate to severe depression; and 51% moderate to severe insomnia. Thirteen percent screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder. Frontline staff (p </= 0.001 vs. others) and females (p < 0.001 vs. males) endorsed thehighest levels of distress, while race (p </= 0.005) and ethnicity (p < 0.03 for anxiety, PTSD and insomnia) had a complex and nuanced interaction with symptoms. Conclusion: Pandemic stress effects all healthcare employees, though not equally.The effects of work role and environment are intuitive though critical. Thesedata suggest individual diversity factors also play an important role in mentalhealth and wellbeing. All must be considered to optimize employee functioning.

AB  - Objectives: Evaluating the drug resistance (DR) profiles of LLV patients and the influencing factors of treatment effects in Jiangsu Province. Method: The Polgene (Reverse transcriptase and protease) was amplified and sequenced to identifythe genotypes and DR profiles among LLV patients in 2021. Questionnaire surveywas conducted among HIV/AIDS patients to investigate the potential influencefactors of treatment effects. Results: 242 Pol genes were amplified from 345specimens, and ten genotypes were detected. The DR rate was 40.5%, with 66, 86,and 14 being resistant to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, respectively. Patients treated with the 2NRTIs+PIs regimen were detected with more DR; and drug resistance wasless detected in married or cohabiting patients than unmarried patients.Non-smokers were less likely to develop LLV at follow-up than smokers; patientswith stage II clinical stage at diagnosis and using 2NRTIs+PIs regimen were also more likely to develop LLV at follow-up. Conclusion: Drug resistance profiles in LLV patients are severe and differ in treatment regimens and marital statuses.Meanwhile, smoking history, clinical stage, and treatment regimen may influencethe therapeutic effect. It is necessary to include LLV people in the free drugresistance testing program.

AB  - Methods of communications and the nature of messaging are critically important ininfluencing public behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in majordisruptions to all aspects of life globally and has triggered multiple approachesof health messaging to the general public to communicate COVID-19 preventativemeasures. This study aimed to identify: (1) differences between age groups in themain avenues used by people to obtain COVID-19 related information; and (2)whether age and information sources were associated with correct interpretationof government messaging relating to how people understand or interpret the terms "self-isolation" and "social distancing." An online survey was conducted in 2020.Participants were aged over 18 years and grouped into age group decades.Differences in sources of COVID-19 information were compared visually between agegroups. Logistic regression was used to determine whether age and each of thevarious methods of communication of COVID-19 information were independentlyassociated with correct response to the self-isolation, or the social distancing statements. There were 3,300 survey respondents 85% female; age sub-groups: 18-29(7.4%); 30-39 (10.6%); 40-49 (17.6%); 50-59 (22.9%); 60-69 (25.9%); 70-79(13.9%); and 80+ (1.7%). People accessed public health messaging information froma wide variety of sources that changed as they aged (e.g., older people were morelikely to be exposed to COVID-19 information via television news programs andless likely via social media platforms). Age was frequently associated withwhether the message key terms were interpreted correctly or incorrectly, but insome cases, it promoted more correct responses whereas in others, fewer correctresponses. There was no difference between being exposed to COVID-19 information via mainstream media, compared with social media, or compared with Governmentsources of information, in terms of whether COVID-19 messages were interpretedcorrectly. In order to improve future public health messaging, there is a needfor multiple avenues of communication to meet the needs and preferences acrossand within age groups. Further investigation is warranted into the clarity of thecontent and method of delivery of public health messages, to ensure optimalunderstanding of public health messages by vulnerable populations and across the community.

AB  - At the end of 2019, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, experienced the ravages ofCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a few months, infected people rose totens of thousands. This study aimed to explore the mental health status ofmilitary nurse personnel assisting (non-Hubei area) in the fight against COVID-19and local nurse personnel (in the Wuhan area), as well as the differences inmental health status between nurses and COVID-19 patients that provide areference basis for psychological crisis intervention. A convenience samplingmethod was used to select frontline nurses and COVID-19 patients (sample size1,000+) from two mobile cabin hospitals from January to March 2020. Thequestionnaire consists of socio-demographic information, Patient HealthQuestionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), General MentalHealth Service Questionnaire and Work Intensity and Physical StatusQuestionnaire. The results showed that depression was present in 117 nurses(19.73%) and 101 patients (23.33%) with PHQ-9 scores >10; anxiety was present in 60 nurses (10.12%) and 54 patients (12.47%) with GAD-7 >10. The anxiety anddepression levels of nurses in Wuhan area were higher than those in non-Hubeiarea. The differences in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were also statisticallysignificant (p < 0.001) when comparing patients from different regions, withanxiety and depression rates of 30.19 and 16.04% in local patients and 16.74 and 9.50% in foreign patients. The comparison between nurses and patients showed thatthe nurses were more depressed than the patients, while the patients were moreanxious. Local nurses in Wuhan had a higher workload intensity than aid nurses(77.72 vs. 57.29%). Over 95% of frontline nurses and patients reported that they had not received any form of psychological counseling before the COVID-19outbreak. 12.87% (26/194) of frontline nurses in Wuhan had a history of takinghypnotic drugs. However, fewer patients (16/212, 7.55%) took medication thanfrontline nurses. Anxiety and depression levels were far higher among localnurses and patients in Wuhan than in non-Hubei areas. The nurses had higherlevels of depression, while the patients had higher anxiety levels. Providingtargeted mental health services to healthcare professionals and patients isnecessary when experiencing the impact of a major event.

AB  - To inform women of the Navajo Nation of safety measures implemented to minimizeCOVID-19 virus exposure during screening and treatment procedures at NavajoNation based health care facilities, the Navajo Nation Breast and Cervical CancerPrevention Program (NNBCCPP) and the University-based Partnership for NativeAmerican Cancer Prevention Program (NACP) collaborated to develop a podcast todescribe the continued availability of services. During the COVID-19 pandemic,women of all ages and ethnicities in the US needing breast and cervical cancerprevention screenings and treatment, have been hesitant to seek services giventhe advice to avoid crowded spaces and maintain physical distancing.Epidemiological trends indicate that proactive, intensive strategies are neededin Native American communities for early detection and treatment to support earlycancer diagnosis and improve cancer survival. The NNBCCPP and Northern ArizonaUniversity (NAU) through the National Institute of Health's National CancerInstitute funded NACP had a nascent partnership prior to the onset of COVID-19pandemic. This partnership relied on face-to-face interaction to allow forinformal social interaction, facilitate clear communication and support continuedtrust building. To adhere to federal, state and tribal recommendations tominimize gatherings and to stay in-place to minimize the spread of the virus, theNavajo Nation and NAU restricted, and in most cases would not approve employeetravel for partnership meetings. The plans to develop a podcast necessitatedbringing additional members into the collaboration who were unfamiliar to theoriginal partners and due to travel restrictions, required all interactions to beremote. This expanded group met virtually to develop a script, record and editthe podcast. More importantly, group members had to build and maintain trust overmonths of communicating via a teleconference video platform. This collaborativeaddressed challenges related to unstable Internet connections and periodicstay-at-home policies; thus, these emerging partners had to modify social andprofessional communication to respect and accommodate the stress and uncertaincircumstances created by the pandemic on the citizens and employees of NavajoNation. This case study describes strategies used to maintain and respect allmembers of the partnership.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. The mostrecent variant is Omicron (line B.1.1.529), which was first identified in SouthAfrica in November 2021. The concern with this variant is the ineffectiveness of vaccines currently available. We aim to systematically evaluate the effectivenessof the currently available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters for the Omicronvariant. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web ofScience databases from inception to June 5th, 2022. Studies that examined theeffectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against the Omicron variant infection wereincluded. Random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled vaccineeffectiveness against the Omicron variant. Results: A total of 13 studies wereincluded to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine against the Omicronvariant, and 11 studies were included to compare the effectiveness between thetwo-dose and three-dose (booster) vaccinations. Full vaccination (two-dose withor without booster) showed a protective effect against the Omicron variantcompared to no vaccination (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.56-0.69), while theeffectiveness decreased significantly over 6 months after the last dose. Thetwo-dose vaccination plus booster provided better protection against the Omicron variant compared to the two-dose vaccination without booster (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.68). Additional analysis was performed for the most commonly used vaccinesin the United Staes: BNT162b2(Pfizer) (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52-0.82) andmRNA-1273(Moderna) (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.58-0.88) vaccines in the US, whichshowed similar effectiveness compared to no vaccination. Conclusions: The fulldose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectively reduces infection from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant; however, the effectiveness wanes over time. The booster vaccine provides additional protection against the Omicron variant.

AB  - Background: Area deprivation has been shown to be associated with various adversehealth outcomes including communicable as well as non-communicable diseases. Our objective was to assess potential associations between area deprivation andCOVID-19 standardized incidence and mortality ratios in Bavaria over a period of nearly 2 years. Bavaria is the federal state with the highest infection dynamics in Germany and demographically comparable to several other European countries.Methods: In this retrospective, observational ecological study, we estimated the strength of associations between area deprivation and standardized COVID-19incidence and mortality ratios (SIR and SMR) in Bavaria, Germany. We usedofficial SARS-CoV-2 reporting data aggregated in monthly periods between March 1,2020 and December 31, 2021. Area deprivation was assessed using the quintiles of the 2015 version of the Bavarian Index of Multiple Deprivation (BIMD 2015) atdistrict level, analyzing the overall index as well as its single domains.Results: Deprived districts showed higher SIR and SMR than less depriveddistricts. Aggregated over the whole period, the SIR increased by 1.04 (95%confidence interval (95% CI): 1.01 to 1.07, p = 0.002), and the SMR by 1.11 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.16, p < 0.001) per BIMD quintile. This represents a maximumdifference of 41% between districts in the most and least deprived quintiles inthe SIR and 110% in the SMR. Looking at individual months revealed clear linearassociation between the BIMD quintiles and the SIR and SMR in the first, secondand last quarter of 2021. In the summers of 2020 and 2021, infection activity waslow. Conclusions: In more deprived areas in Bavaria, Germany, higher incidenceand mortality ratios were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic with particularlystrong associations during infection waves 3 and 4 in 2020/2021. Only highinfection levels reveal the effect of risk factors and socioeconomicinequalities. There may be confounding between the highly deprived areas andborder regions in the north and east of Bavaria, making the relationship between area deprivation and infection burden more complex. Vaccination appeared tobalance incidence and mortality rates between the most and least depriveddistricts. Vaccination makes an important contribution to health equality.

AB  - Background: In September 2021, there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Xiamen, China. Various non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) andpharmacological interventions (PIs) have been implemented to prevent and control the spread of the disease. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness ofvarious interventions and to identify priorities for the implementation ofprevention and control measures. Methods: The data of patients with COVID-19 werecollected from 8 to 30 September 2021. A Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered(SEIR) dynamics model was developed to fit the data and simulate theeffectiveness of interventions (medical treatment, isolation, social distancing, masking, and vaccination) under different scenarios. The effective reproductivenumber (R eff ) was used to assess the transmissibility and transmission risk.Results: A total of 236 cases of COVID-19 were reported in Xiamen. The epidemiccurve was divided into three phases (R eff = 6.8, 1.5, and 0). Notably, thecumulative number of cases was reduced by 99.67% due to the preventive andcontrol measures implemented by the local government. In the effectivecontainment stage, the number of cases could be reduced to 115 by intensifyingthe implementation of interventions. The total number of cases (TN) could bereduced by 29.66-95.34% when patients voluntarily visit fever clinics. When only two or three of these measures are implemented, the simulated TN may be greaterthan the actual number. As four measures were taken simultaneously, the TN may be<100, which is 57.63% less than the actual number. The simultaneousimplementation of five interventions could rapidly control the transmission andreduce the number of cases to fewer than 25. Conclusion: With the joint effortsof the government and the public, the outbreak was controlled quickly andeffectively. Authorities could promptly cut the transmission chain and controlthe spread of the disease when patients with fever voluntarily went to thehospital. The ultimate effect of controlling the outbreak through only oneintervention was not obvious. The combined community control and mask wearing,along with other interventions, could lead to rapid control of the outbreak andultimately lower the total number of cases. More importantly, this would mitigatethe impact of the outbreak on society and socioeconomics.

AB  - Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with sleep qualityimpairment and psychological distress, and the general public has responded tothe pandemic and quarantine requirements in a variety of ways. We aimed toinvestigate whether sleep quality is low during a short-term (circuit break)quarantine restriction, and whether sleep quality is associated with respondents'overall attitudes to the pandemic using a validated scale. Design and Setting:Online cross-sectional study in England in November 2020. Participants: The studyincluded 502 respondents over the age of 18. Measurements: Sleep quality wasassessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and pandemic attitudes were assessed using the Oxford Pandemic Attitudes Scale-COVID-19 (OPAS-C), avalidated 20-item, 7-domain scale that assesses pandemic-related stress, fear,loneliness, sense of community, sense of exaggerated concern, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and vaccine hesitancy. Unadjusted and multivariable logisticregression odds ratios of association were assessed between the dependentvariable of poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) and risk factors, including OPAS-C score,age, sex, educational status, and income. Results: The mean (SD) PSQI score was7.62 (3.49). Overall, 68.9% of respondents met criteria for poor sleep qualityusing the PSQI cutoff of >5. The mean (SD) OPAS-C score was 60.3 (9.1). There wasa significantly increased odds of poor sleep quality in the highest vs. lowestOPAS-C quartiles (OR 4.94, 95% CI [2.67, 9.13], p < 0.0001). Age, sex, income,political leaning, employment status, and education attainment were notassociated with poor sleep quality. Conclusions: More than two-thirds ofrespondents met criteria for poor sleep quality. The odds of poor sleep qualityincreased in a dose-response relationship with pandemic attitudes (such as higherlevels of pandemic-related stress, fear, or loneliness). The association between poor sleep quality and pandemic attitudes suggests opportunities for publichealth and sleep medicine interventions, and highlights the need for furtherresearch.

AB  - Background: Remote monitoring through digital technology offers a promisingsolution for the diverse medical, psychological and social issues that plaguepatients with COVID-19 under home-isolation, but remain neglected due to a lackof streamlined medical services for these patients. Methods: This prospectivecohort study determined the feasibility of remote telemonitoring of healthcareworkers with mild COVID-19 under home isolation during the Omicron (B1.1.529)wave and characterized their clinico-demographic profile. A holistic monitoringmodel comprising of mandatory phone calls at the beginning and end of isolation, assisted by home oximetry, predesigned google forms, and opt-in software-based(eSanjeevani OPD) teleconsultation was employed. Factors associated withdevelopment of symptomatic disease were also determined. Results: Out of 100COVID-19 positive healthcare workers under home-isolation, data for 94participants was available [median age 27(20-52) years, 56(60%) females]. 93(99%)patients were previously vaccinated for COVID-19 (median time from last dose =248 days); 34(36%) had a past history of COVID-19. Fever (67%), myalgia (69%),sore throat/dry cough (70%), and running nose (45%) were the most commonsymptoms. No patient progressed to moderate-severe disease or required careescalation during the remote monitoring period. Most participants reportedseveral additional psychosocial concerns which were adequately addressed.Symptomatic patients had higher BMI (24.1 vs. 21.8kg/m(2), p = 0.01) compared to asymptomatic patients. Age, past infection with COVID-19, and time since lastvaccine dose were not different between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.Conclusion: COVID-19 patients under home isolation have multi-faceted medical andpsychosocial issues which can be holistically managed remotely through digitaltechnology.

AB  - Immunotherapy is at the cutting edge of modern cancer treatment. Innovativemedicines have been developed with varying degrees of success that target allaspects of tumor biology: tumors, niches, and the immune system. Oncolyticviruses (OVs) are a novel and potentially immunotherapeutic approach for cancertreatment. OVs reproduce exclusively in cancer cells, causing the tumor mass tolyse. OVs can also activate the immune system in addition to their primaryactivity. Tumors create an immunosuppressive environment by suppressing theimmune system's ability to respond to tumor cells. By injecting OVs into thetumor, the immune system is stimulated, allowing it to generate a robust andlong-lasting response against the tumor. The essential biological properties ofoncolytic viruses, as well as the underlying mechanisms that enable their usageas prospective anticancer medicines, are outlined in this review. We also discussthe increased efficacy of virotherapy when combined with other cancermedications.

TI  - Subpial delivery of adeno-associated virus 9-synapsin-caveolin-1 (AAV9-SynCav1)preserves motor neuron and neuromuscular junction morphology, motor function,delays disease onset, and extends survival in hSOD1(G93A) mice.
PG  - 5389-5403

AB  - Elevating neuroprotective proteins using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediatedgene delivery shows great promise in combating devastating neurodegenerativediseases. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one such disease resulting from loss of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) with 90-95% of cases sporadic (SALS) in nature. Due to the unknown etiology of SALS, interventions that affordneuronal protection and preservation are urgently needed. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), amembrane/lipid rafts (MLRs) scaffolding and neuroprotective protein, andMLR-associated signaling components are decreased in degenerating neurons inpostmortem human brains. We previously showed that, when crossing our SynCav1transgenic mouse (TG) with the mutant human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1(G93A)) mouse model of ALS, the double transgenic mouse (SynCav1 TG/hSOD1(G93A))exhibited better motor function and longer survival. The objective of the currentstudy was to test whether neuron-targeted Cav-1 upregulation in the spinal cordusing AAV9-SynCav1 could improve motor function and extend longevity in mutanthumanized mouse and rat (hSOD1(G93A)) models of familial (F)ALS. Methods: Motorfunction was assessed by voluntary running wheel (RW) in mice and forelimb gripstrength (GS) and motor evoked potentials (MEP) in rats. Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was used to assess MN morphology.Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) were measured by bungarotoxin-a (Btx-a) andsynaptophysin IF. Body weight (BW) was measured weekly, and the survival curvewas determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Following subpial gene deliveryto the lumbar spinal cord, male and female hSOD1G93A mice treated with SynCav1exhibited delayed disease onset, greater running-wheel performance, preservedspinal alpha-motor neuron morphology and NMJ integrity, and 10% increasedlongevity, independent of affecting expression of the mutant hSOD1G93A protein.Cervical subpial SynCav1 delivery to hSOD1G93A rats preserved forelimb GS andMEPs in the brachial and gastrocnemius muscles. Conclusion: In summary, subpialdelivery of SynCav1 protects and preserves spinal motor neurons, and extendslongevity in a familial mouse model of ALS without reducing the toxic monogeniccomponent. Furthermore, subpial SynCav1 delivery preserved neuromuscular functionin a rat model of FALS. The latter findings strongly indicate the therapeuticapplicability of SynCav1 to treat ALS attributed to monogenic (FALS) andpotentially in sporadic cases (i.e., SALS).

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cell derived brain organoids offer an unprecedentedopportunity for various applications as in vitro model. Currently, human brainorganoids as models have been used to understand virus-induced neurotoxicity.Methods: The brain organoids were separately challenged by multiple virusesincluding influenza viruses (H1N1-WSN and H3N2-HKT68), Enteroviruses (EV68 andEV71) and Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV) toinvestigate the impaired effect of these viruses on human brain development.Results: The brain organoids challenged by influenza viruses had decreasedoverall organoid size, while enteroviruses infected brain organoids displayed theopposite result. Then, we found WSN preferentially infected MAP2+ neuronscompared to SOX2+ neural stem cells (NSCs) and GFAP+ astrocytes in brainorganoids, and induced apoptosis of NSCs and neurons, and released inflammatoryfactors (TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, and IL-6), facilitating brain damage. Furthermore,transcriptional profiling revealed several co-upregulated genes (CSAG3 and OAS2) and co-downregulated genes (CDC20B, KCNJ13, OTX2-AS1) after WSN infection for 24 hpi and 96 hpi, implicating target for antiviral drugs development. Finally, weexplored compound PYC-12 could significantly suppress virus infection, apoptosis,and inflammatory responses. Conclusions: Collectively, we established a tractableexperimental model to investigate the impact and mechanism of virus infection on human brain development.

TI  - Dedifferentiated Schwann cell-derived TGF-beta3 is essential for the neuralsystem to promote wound healing.
PG  - 5470-5487
LID - 10.7150/thno.72317 [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Wound healing is among the most complicated physiological processesand requires the synchronization of various cell types with distinct roles tore-establish the condition of the original skin. Patients affected by peripheral neuropathies often experience failure to heal. Loss of Schwann cells (SCs), acrucial population of peripheral nervous system cells in skin, may contribute to chronic wounds. However, the role of SCs in wound healing are poorly understood. Methods: The activity of SCs was investigated by using a cell atlas of the wound healing process, which was generated by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq) libraries covering different states of mouse back skin. The resultsof in silico analysis were validated by in vitro cell culture and in vivo mousemodel. Selective inhibitors and conditional RNAi by virus transfection wereutilized to investigate the role of SCs in wound healing. Findings from mouseexperiments were further verified in scRNA-seq analysis of diabetic patients.Results: Our in silico analysis revealed the heterogeneous cellular components ofskin and the dynamic interactions of neural crest derived cells (NCs) with other cell types. We found that SCs dedifferentiated at an early stage of wound repair with upregulated Wnt signaling. We also identified dedifferentiated SC (dSC)defect in diabetic wounds in both mouse and human. Wnt inhibition at the woundsite repressed SC dedifferentiation, leading to defective repair. Furthermore,dSCs derived TGF-beta3, which is context-dependent, promoted the migration offibroblasts and keratinocytes. Moreover, TGF-beta3 supplementation enhanced thehealing of chronic wounds in diabetic mice with impaired SCs. Conclusion: Ourstudy thus advances the understanding of the roles of neural-derived cells inskin regeneration and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for wound healingdisorders.

TI  - DNA aptamers inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein binding to hACE2 by an RBD-independent or dependent approach.
PG  - 5522-5536
LID - 10.7150/thno.74428 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Nobody knows when the COVID-19 pandemic will end or when and where thenext coronavirus will outbreak. Therefore, it is still necessary to developSARS-CoV-2 inhibitors for different variants or even the new coronavirus. SinceSARS-CoV-2 uses its surface spike-protein to recognize hACE2, mediating its entryinto cells, ligands that can specifically recognize the spike-protein have thepotential to prevent infection. Methods: We have recently discovered DNA aptamersagainst the S2-domain of the WT spike-protein by exploiting the selection processcalled SELEX. After optimization, among all candidates, the aptamer S2A2C1 hasthe shortest sequence and the best binding affinity toward the S2-protein. Moreimportantly, the S2A2C1 aptamer does not bind to the RBD of the spike-protein,but it efficiently blocks the spike-protein/hACE2 interaction, suggesting anRBD-independent inhibition approach. To further improve its performance, weconjugated the S2A2C1 aptamer with a reported anti-RBD aptamer, S1B6C3, usingvarious linkers and constructed hetero-bivalent fusion aptamers. Bindingaffinities of mono and fusion aptamers against the spike-proteins were measured. The inhibition efficacies of mono and fusion aptamers to prevent thehACE2/spike-protein interaction were determined using ELISA. Results:Anti-spike-protein aptamers, including S2A2C1 and S1B6C3-A5-S2A2C1, maintainedhigh binding affinity toward the WT, Delta, and Omicron spike-proteins and highinhibition efficacies to prevent them from binding to hACE2, rendering themwell-suited as diagnostic and therapeutic molecular tools to target SARS-CoV-2and its variants. Conclusions: Overall, we discovered the anti-S2 aptamer,S2A2C1, which inhibits the hACE2/spike-protein interaction via an RBD-independentapproach. The anti-S2 and anti-RBD aptamers were conjugated to obtain the fusion aptamer, S1B6C3-A5-S2A2C1, which recognizes the spike-protein by an RBD-dependentapproach. Our strategies, which discovered aptamer inhibitors targeting thehighly conserved S2-protein, as well as the design of fusion aptamers, can beused to target new coronaviruses as they emerge.

AB  - The novel coronavirus that has affected the whole world is declared a pandemic bythe World Health Organization. Since the emergence of this virus, researchersworldwide have searched for potential antivirals against it. Being an RNA virus, it shows a high rate of mutability and variability in its genome. In the present study, all the reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from diverse regions of theworld available in the GISAID database have been considered for phylogeneticanalysis. The strain identified at the root is subjected to phylogenetic analysiswith genomes of other known human viruses obtained from NCBI for identifying the nearest viral neighbor. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationship betweenvarious human viruses was used to repurpose the known antiviral drugs towardscoronavirus using in silico docking approach. The phylogeny reveals the link ofthe COVID virus with adenovirus. The known drugs against adenovirus areconsidered in the present study for drug repurposing through molecular dockinganalysis. The reference inhibitors of the respective targets were also consideredin the docking study. The protein targets, namely protease, endoribonuclease,methyltransferase, phosphatase, and spike protein, are considered for screeningwith the known drug of adenovirus. Ribavirin, known to treat adenoviralinfection, shows the best docking score, suggesting its use as a repurposed drug to treat SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the potency of the ribavirin drug is analyzedusing molecular dynamics studies.

AB  - The structural proteins of coronaviruses portray critical information to address issues of classification, assembly constraints, and evolutionary pathwaysinvolving host shifts. We compiled 173 complete protein sequences from isolatesbelonging to the four genera of the subfamily Coronavirinae. We calculate asingle matrix of viral distance as a linear combination of protein distances. Theminimum spanning tree (MST) connecting the individuals captures the structure of their similarities. The MST re-capitulates the known phylogeny of Coronovirinae. Hosts were mapped onto the MST and we found a non-trivial concordance betweenhost phylogeny and viral proteomic distance. We also study the chimerism in ourdataset through computational simulations. We found evidence that structuralunits coming from loosely related hosts hardly give rise to feasible chimeras in nature. This work offers a fresh way to analyze features of SARS-CoV-2 andrelated viruses.

LID - 10.1016/j.trip.2022.100665 [doi]
AB  - To ensure safety against the COVID-19, along with all other countries, Bangladeshas a least-developed country needs to deal with the changes in travel behavior,particularly changes in mode choice behavior. As Dhaka has been marked as ahotspot for the virus contagion, this paper has focused on the changes in modechoice behavior of Dhaka people due to the COVID-19 pandemic while they are onthe road. A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted to capture theinformation on mode preferences and perspectives on travel characteristics forcommute and discretionary trips before and during COVID-19. Multinomial Logit(MNL) model based on a utility function has been used to investigate thesignificance of the socio-demographic attributes and travel characteristics ofthe trips on the mode choice behavior and to calculate the maximum utility of themode choice. This study highlighted some noticeable changes in perspectivetowards mode choice. People prefer walking, private cars, and rickshaw moreduring the pandemic as they feel these modes are more reliable, available, andcost-effective in this crucial time. Usage of public transportation droppeddrastically for discretionary purposes. Additionally, usage of the on-demandvehicle increased during the pandemic as a large portion of commuters shifted to on-demand vehicles from public transportation. Furthermore, this paper suggested some viable policy-making implications to cope with the current pandemic andrelatable future national and global crises. Finally, the paper concludes bysuggesting some future research insights.

AB  - Knowledge of virus-host interactomes has advanced exponentially in the lastdecade by the use of high-throughput screening technologies to obtain a morecomprehensive landscape of virus-host protein-protein interactions. In thisarticle, we present a systematic review of the available virus-hostprotein-protein interaction database resources. The resources covered in thisreview are both generic virus-host protein-protein interaction databases anddatabases of protein-protein interactions for a specific virus or for thoseviruses that infect a particular host. The databases are reviewed on the basis ofthe specificity for a particular virus or host, the number of virus-hostprotein-protein interactions included, and the functionality in terms of browse, search, visualization, and download. Further, we also analyze the overlap of the databases, that is, the number of virus-host protein-protein interactions shared by the various databases, as well as the structure of the virus-hostprotein-protein interaction network, across viruses and hosts.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) exhibit important roles in the immunesystem maintenance. In poultry, PRL mainly plays its roles in nesting, hatching, and reproduction, while GH is primarily responding to body weight, fat formation and feed conversion. In this review, we attempt to provide a critical overview ofthe relationship between PRL and GH, PRLR and GHR, and the immune response ofpoultry. We also propose a hypothesis that PRL, GH and their receptors might beused by viruses as viral receptors. This may provide new insights into thepathogenesis of viral infection and host immune response.

AB  - Understanding phage-host relationships is crucial for the study of virus biology and the application of phages in biotechnology and medicine. However, informationconcerning the range of hosts for bacterial and archaeal viruses is scatteredacross numerous databases and is difficult to obtain. Therefore, here we present PHD (Phage & Host Daily), a web application that offers a comprehensive,up-to-date catalog of known phage-host associations that allows users to selectviruses targeting specific bacterial and archaeal taxa of interest. Our servicecombines the latest information on virus-host interactions from seven sourcedatabases with current taxonomic classification retrieved directly from thegroups and institutions responsible for its maintenance. The web application alsoprovides summary statistics on host and virus diversity, their pairwiseinteractions, and the host range of deposited phages. PHD is updated daily andavailable at http://phdaily.info or http://combio.pl/phdaily.

PG  - 936502
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.936502 [doi]
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) CRF01_AE/B recombinants are newlyemerging strains that are spreading rapidly in Southern and Eastern China. Thisstudy aimed to elucidate the molecular epidemiological characteristics of HIV-1CRF01_AE/B recombinants in Nanjing and to explore the impact of these novelstrains on the immunological status. A total of 1,013 blood samples from newlydiagnosed HIV-1-infected patients were collected in Nanjing from 2015 to 2019,among which 958 partial Pol sequences were sequenced successfully. We depictedthe molecular epidemiological characteristics of CRF01_AE/B recombinants by themolecular evolutionary analysis, Bayesian system evolution analysis, andtransmission network analysis. The generalized additive mixed model was appliedto evaluate the CD4(+) T-cell count change of CRF01_AE/B recombinants. TheKaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the time from combinedantiretroviral therapy (cART) initiation to immune reconstruction. We haveidentified 102 CRF01_AE/B recombinants (102/958, 10.65%) in Nanjing, includingCRF67_01B (45/102, 44.12%), CRF68_01B (35/102, 34.31%), and CRF55_01B (22/102,12.57%). According to the Bayesian phylogenetic inference, CRF55_01B had a rapid decline stage during 2017-2019, while CRF67_01B and CRF68_01B have experienced a fast growth phase during 2014-2015 and then remained stable. We have constructed 83 transmission networks, in which three larger clusters were composed ofCRF67_01B and CRF68_01B. CRF01_AE/B recombinants manifested a faster decreaserate of CD4(+) T-cell count than CRF_07BC but similar to CRF01_AE. Theprobability of achieving immune reconstruction in CRF01_AE/B recombinants waslower than CRF07_BC in the subgroup of baseline CD4(+) T-cell count at cARTinitiation <300 cells/mul. In summary, CRF67_01B and CRF68_01B were the majorstrains of CRF01_AE/B recombinants in Nanjing, which have formed largetransmission clusters between Nanjing and other provinces. CRF01_AE/Brecombinants might be associated with rapid disease progression and poor immunereconstruction. The continuous epidemiological monitoring of CRF01_AE/Brecombinants should be highly emphasized.

AB  - In contrast to dog-associated human rabies cases decline year by year due to the rabies vaccination coverage rates increase in China, ferret badger (FB, Melogale moschata)-associated human rabies cases emerged in the 1990s, and are now anincreasingly recognized problem in southeast China. To investigate epidemiology, temporal evolution dynamics, transmission characterization, and pathogenicity of FB-associated rabies viruses (RABVs), from 2008 to 2018, we collected 3,622 FBbrain samples in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Province, and detected 112 RABV isolates.Four FB-related lineages were identified by phylogenetic analysis (lineages A-D),the estimated Times to Most Recent Common Ancestor were 1941, 1990, 1937, and1997 for lineages A-D, respectively. Furthermore, although no FB-associated humanrabies case has been reported there apart from Wuyuan area, FB-RABV isolates are mainly distributed in Jiangxi Province. Pathogenicity of FB-RABVs was assessedusing peripheral inoculation in mice and in beagles with masseter muscles,mortality-rates ranging from 20 to 100% in mice and 0 to 20% in beagles in thegroups infected with the various isolates. Screening of sera from humans with FB bites and no post-exposure prophylaxis to rabies revealed that five of nine were positive for neutralizing antibodies of RABV. All the results above indicatedthat FB-RABV variants caused a lesser pathogenicity in mice, beagles, and evenhumans. Vaccination in mice suggests that inactivated vaccine or recombinantsubunit vaccine products can be used to control FB-associated rabies, however,oral vaccines for stray dogs and wildlife need to be developed and licensed inChina urgently.

AB  - Introduction: Determining the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in blood donors makes the control of virus circulation possible in healthy people and helps implementstrategies to reduce virus transmission. The purpose of the study was to examine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in blood donors using systematic review andmeta-analysis. Materials and Methods: The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus,Web of Science, and the Google Scholar search engine were searched using standardkeywords up to 2022-04-26. The variance of each study was calculated according tothe binomial distribution. Studies were combined according to the sample size andvariance. Q Cochrane test and I2 index were used to examine the heterogeneity of the studies. Data analysis was performed in STATA 14 software, and thesignificance level of the tests was P < 0.05. Results: In the 28 papers examined with 227894 samples, the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in blood donors was 10% (95% CI: 9%, 11%), estimated 5% (95% CI: 4%, 7%) among men and 6% (95% CI: 4%, 7%)among women. This rate in different blood groups was as follows: A 12% (95% CI:10%-14%), B 12% (95% CI: 10%-15%), AB 9% (95% CI: 7%-12%), and O 13% (95% CI:11%-16%). The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in blood donors in North America 10%,Europe 7%, Asia 23%, South America 5%, and Africa was 4%; Moreover, theseroprevalence of IgG antibodies was estimated to be 23% (95% CI: 18%-29%) andIgM 29% (95% CI: 9%-49%). Conclusion: The highest prevalence of COVID-19 serum inwomen blood donors was among blood group O and Asia. The seroprevalence of IgGand IgM antibodies was high too.

TI  - Mobile tablets for real-time data collection for hospital-based birth defectssurveillance in Kampala, Uganda: Lessons learned.
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgph.0000662 [doi]
AB  - Sustainable birth defects surveillance systems provide countries with estimatesof the prevalence of birth defects to guide prevention, care activities, andevaluate interventions. We used free and open-source software (Open Data Kit) to implement an electronic system to collect data for a hospital-based birth defectssurveillance system at four major hospitals in Kampala, Uganda. We describe theestablishment, successes, challenges, and lessons learned from using mobiletablets to capture data and photographs. After intensive training, surveillancemidwives collected data using Android tablets with inbuilt logic checks; another surveillance midwife checked the quality of the data in real-time before datawere securely uploaded onto a local server. Paper forms were used when needed as a backup for the electronic system. We experienced several challengesimplementing the surveillance system, including forgotten passwords, unstablenetwork, reduced tablet speed and freezing, loss of touch-screen sensitivity,decreased battery strength, and repetitive extensive retraining. We addressedthese challenges by backing up and removing all photos from the tablet,uninstalling irrelevant applications to the study to increase storage space andspeed, and monitoring and updating the system based mainly on feedback from themidwives. From August 2015 to December 2018, surveillance midwives documentedinformation on 110,752 births at the participating hospitals. Of these, 110,573(99.8%) were directly entered into the electronic data system and 179 (0.2%) werecaptured on paper forms. The use of mobile tablets for real-time data collection was successful in a hospital-based birth defects surveillance system in aresource-limited setting. Extensive training and follow-up can overcomechallenges and are key to preparing staff for a successful data collectionsystem.

AB  - One of the major crops for food security is cassava. Superabundant Bemisia tabaciwhitefly, comprising unusually high landscape populations of the insect, havebeen implicated in cassava virus emergence. Studies have been unable to selectfrom several hypotheses, however, as to the dynamic drivers of superabundantwhitefly associated with the emergence in East Africa of severe cassava mosaicdisease. One possibility is that pathogenic modification of infected plants canitself increase the growth of insect vector colonies on infected plants.Throughthe modelling of population processes at the landscape scale we introduce aframework for analysing patterns in the association of disease and insectwaves.Our analyses demonstrate the role of pathogen-mediated insectsuperabundance in a plant disease invasion. Synthesis. An elevated abundance ofinsects at the landscape scale is frequently implicated in invasions of the plantpathogens that they carry. We advance ecological understanding of plant diseaseinvasions by showing how landscape data can be used to investigate the causes of insect vector superabundance.

We report the case and imagesof a patient with MPXV presenting with genital lesions later complicated bysuperimposed cellulitis in Colorado, USA. MPXV lesions are susceptible tobacterial superinfection, and with the advent of new cases, the earlyidentification of skin lesions and their evolution during MPXV are imperative fortreating clinicians. Clinicians should consider MPXV in differential diagnoses ofsexually transmitted diseases presenting with genital lesions.

AB  - White spot disease (WSD) has posed a serious threat to the China and the globalshrimp aquaculture. In order to diagnose white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) earlyand prevent the spread and outbreak of WSD, it is necessary to establish a highlysensitive WSSV diagnosis method suitable for shrimp farming sites. In this study,a pre-amplification qPCR assay from the crude extract of samples heated lysis wasestablished, which was further compared with the universal qPCR assay to verifythe shrimp samples. The limit of detection (LOD) of pre-amplification qPCR assay and universal qPCR assay was 2.80 copies and 20.57 copies per reaction at 95% CI,respectively. It had good WSSV specificity and did not show cross-detection ofinfectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), acute hepatopancreasnecrosis disease (AHPND), necrotizing hepatopancreatitis bacteria (NHPB), anddecapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1). A total of 36 shrimp samples were detected as WSSV DNA positive by pre-amplification qPCR with crude extract from samplesheated lysis and universal qPCR with DNA extraction. The diagnostic sensitivityand specificity were 97.22% (85.5 ~ 99.9%, 95% CI) and 100% (81.5 ~ 100%, 95%CI), respectively. The agreement Kappa value was 0.959 (0.879 ~ 1, 95% CI), andthe analysis results were basically consistent. Eliminating the tedious steps of extracting DNA and using pre-amplified qPCR to detect WSSV in shrimp, it is agood choice for aquaculture farms.

TI  - A standardized instrument quantifying risk factors associated with bi-directionaltransmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic pathogens: The COVID-19human-animal interactions survey (CHAIS).
PG  - 100422
LID - 10.1016/j.onehlt.2022.100422 [doi]
AB  - Similar to many zoonotic pathogens which transmit from animals to humans,SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, most likely originated in Rhinolophus bats before spreading among humans globally. Early intothe pandemic, reports of CoV-2 diagnoses in animals from various countriesemerged. While most CoV-2 positive animals were confirmed to have been in closecontact with CoV-2 positive humans, there has been a paucity of publishedevidence to-date describing risk factors associated with CoV-2 transmission amonghumans and animals. The COVID-19 Human-Animal Interactions Survey (CHAIS) wasdeveloped to provide a standardized instrument describing human-animalinteractions during the pandemic and to evaluate behavioral, spatiotemporal, and biological risk factors associated with bi-directional zoonotic transmission ofCoV-2 within shared environments, predominantly households with limitedinformation about human-wildlife or human-livestock interactions. CHAIS measures four broad domains of transmission risk: 1) risk and intensity of infection inhuman hosts, 2) spatial characteristics of shared environments, 3) behaviors and human-animal interactions, and 4) susceptible animal subpopulations. Followingthe development of CHAIS, with a One Health approach, a multidisciplinary groupof experts (n = 20) was invited to review and provide feedback on the survey for content validity. Expert feedback was incorporated into two final surveyformats-an extended version and an abridged version for which specific corequestions addressing zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission were identified. Both versions are modularized, with each section having the capacity to serve as independent instruments, allowing researchers to customize the survey based oncontext and research-specific needs. Further adaptations for studies seeking toinvestigate other zoonotic pathogens with similar routes of transmission (i.e.respiratory, direct contact) are also possible. The CHAIS instrument is astandardized human-animal interaction survey developed to provide important data on risk factors that guide transmission of CoV-2, and other similar pathogens,among humans and animals.

AB  - With the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, educational systems worldwide wereabruptly affected and hampered, causing nearly total suspension of all in-person activities in schools, colleges, and universities. Government officialsprohibited the physical gatherings in educational institutions to reduce thespread of the virus. Therefore, educational institutions have aggressivelyshifted to alternative learning methods and strategies such as online-basedplatforms-to seemingly avoid the disruption of education. However, the switchfrom the face-to-face setting to an entirely online setting introduced a seriesof challenges, especially for the deaf or hard-of-hearing students. Variousrecent studies have revealed the underlying infrastructure used by academicinstitutions may not be suitable for students with hearing impairments. The goal of this study is to perform a literature review of these studies and extract the pressing challenges that deaf and hard-of-hearing students have been facing sincetheir transition to the online setting. We conducted a systematic literaturereview of 34 articles that were carefully collected, retrieved, and rigorouslycategorized from various scholarly databases. The articles, included in thisstudy, focused primarily on highlighting high-demanding issues that deaf studentsexperienced in higher education during the pandemic. This study contributes tothe research literature by providing a detailed analysis of technologicalchallenges hindering the learning experience of deaf students. Furthermore, thestudy extracts takeaways and proposed solutions, from the literature, forresearchers, education specialists, and higher education authorities to adopt.This work calls for investigating broader and yet more effective teaching andlearning strategies for deaf and hard-of-hearing students so that they canbenefit from a better online learning experience.

TI  - Families in quarantine for COVID-19 in Italy. Resilience as a buffer of parental distress and problematic children's emotions and behaviors.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/s12144-022-03374-7 [doi]
AB  - The pandemic of Covid-19 has had a high impact on people's lives and especiallyon families. In Italy, in 2020, the several forced closures led families to live indoors to manage anxiety and distress. It was considered appropriate toinvestigate which protective factors, like parental resilience, can mitigate the negative impact of pandemic-related distress on family life. We have conductedtwo online surveys during different national lockdowns for Covid-19. The firstsurvey was conducted immediately after the disruption of the virus and the secondone after nine months. We measured parental resilience and distress, anxiety,problematic behaviors, and somatization of their children (as assessed by theparents). The aim was to investigate the protective role of parental resiliencein mitigating parental distress and in turn problematic emotional states andbehavior of their children. Mediation analyses confirmed the hypothesis thatparental resilience lowers parental distress and consequently the anxiety andbehavioral disorders of their children in both acute distress (first study) andchronic distress (second study) situations. Such results suggest that theimprovement of parents' resilience can buffer the negative impact ofpandemic-related parental distress and children's behavioral problems on bothoccasions. The need for focused interventions and treatments aimed to reinforceparental resilience is discussed. Targeted prevention and support strategies are needed now, and early in case of future health crises.

AB  - Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is an important staple food around the world, andpotato virus Y (PVY) is a major constraint for potato production. The VPg proteinof PVY interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4E of the host thatworks as a susceptibility factor during infection. The interaction between eIF4E and VPg was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9. The homozygous conserved region of eIF4E ofthe potato variety "Kruda" was mutated by CRISPR/Cas9. Tracking of insertion,deletion, and conversion events was performed by Sanger sequencing withapproximately 15% editing efficiency. Truncated and mutated eIF4E proteins wereunable to interact with VPg, and the virus was not able to exploit the hostmachinery for replication and systemic spreading. Mutated eIF4E lines showedenhanced resistance to PVY(O) strain. DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR were used forvalidation of the observed resistance. PVY resistance in tetraploid lines viaCRISPR/Cas9 provides a route to develop novel resistant potato cultivars.

AB  - Several foreign antigens such as those derived from viruses and bacteria havebeen linked to long-term deleterious effects on the brain and other organs; yet, health outcomes subsequent to foreign antigen exposure vary depending in largepart on the host's immune system, in general, and on human leukocyte antigen(HLA) composition, in particular. Here we first provide a brief description of 3 conditions characterized by persistent long-term symptoms, namely long-COVID-19, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and Gulf War Illness(GWI), followed by a brief overview of the role of HLA in the immune response to foreign antigens. We then discuss our Persistent Antigen (PA) hypothesis andhighlight associations between antigen persistence due to HLA-antigenincongruence and chronic health conditions in general and the 3 "long" diseasesabove in particular. This review is not intended to cover the breadth and depthof symptomatology of those diseases but is specifically focused on the hypothesisthat the presence of persistent antigens underlies their pathogenesis.

PG  - 33

AB  - There is scanty data on overall pediatric presentations with COVID-19 insub-Saharan Africa and none reported related to stroke. Management of acutestroke in children has been challenging due to delays in presentation anddifficulties in deducing the exact etiology. This is the first such case of astroke in a child with COVID-19 infection reported in Tanzania to the best of ourknowledge. A six-and-a-half-year-old male child of Asian origin with no historyof chronic illness presented to our facility with fever, rash, gastrointestinalsymptoms and conjunctivitis. Subsequently, he developed headache, irritability,altered mentation, loss of speech, facial nerve palsy and hemiparesis. He wasprovisionally diagnosed with bacterial meningitis with a differential diagnosisof viral encephalitis and received standard treatment for the same. On furtherinvestigations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed ischemicinfarct along the territory of left middle cerebral artery and given the history of the child s exposure to a relative with COVID-19 infection, child underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for polymerase chain reaction testing which was negative but the serum IgG for COVID was positive. Despite the severe presentation initially, early detection and appropriate management resulted in survival, regained speech and motor function. Due to constraints in health care systems in sub-SaharanAfrica, it is difficult to exhaust the diagnostics in order to narrow down thelist of differentials in a child with stroke. This case is reported to furtherdescribe the diverse presentations of COVID-19 particularly in children which hasbeen under-represented especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Attending physiciansshould have a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 as the etiology for exposed children presenting with neurological symptoms.

AB  - Introduction: the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdowns restrictedmovement with non-essential hospital trips discouraged to prevent spread of thevirus. Disruption of medical services can lead to increased seeking of medicaladvice and symptom management online. With COVID-19 known to worsen existingcardiovascular disease or precipitate a new one, we sought to explore onlinesearch trends of the Nigerian public regarding cardiac events before and duringthe COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: using Google Trends, relative search volume forthe terms 'cardiac arrest', 'heart attack', and 'heart arrest' were analyzed for the periods 27(th) February to 30(th) September in 2019 and 2020 respectively.Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test for relative search volume, searchterms comparison in both years and Kendall s correlation coefficient forexamining relationships between time frames and search terms were used. Results: searches for terms 'heart attack' (p<0.001) and 'heart arrest' (p=0.01) werehigher in 2020 compared to 2019, with a correlation between searches for 'cardiacarrest' and 'heart arrest' (p<0.001) and between 'heart attack' and 'heartarrest' (p=0.01). There was a strong positive correlation between search for'heart attack' in 2019 and 2020 (tau b=0.35, p<0.001); and a moderate positivecorrelation for 'heart arrest' (tau b=0.13, p=0.01). Conclusion: increased onlineactivity relating to cardiac arrest was recorded during the early months of thepandemic when compared to the year prior. Notable increases in search activityaligned with the timing of heart-related illnesses and deaths of Nigeriancelebrities during the pandemic. Further understanding of health-related onlinesearch activity in Nigeria could inform the development of health promotioninterventions and support health-related information seeking for cardiovasculardiseases.

AB  - Monkeypox is a rare zoonotic infection caused by monkeypox virus. It is anemerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since theglobal eradication of smallpox in 1980. It is a mild illness which is mostlycharacterized by a prodromal of fever, malaise and progressive appearance ofvesiculo-papular skin lesions. We report a case of a 30-year-old militarypersonnel who was referred from 23 Brigade Medical Centre (BMC) to FederalMedical Centre (FMC) Yola on account of fever and progressive eruption ofwidespread skin rashes. Following isolation from suspicion of monkeypox, he wasconfirmed by PCR and managed symptomatically and fully recovered within two weeksof onset. His five close contacts did not develop any symptoms during the period of follow-up. This is the first confirmed case of monkey pox in the state. Thiscase will trigger an awareness, amongst clinicians and surveillance officers inAdamawa State, of the existence of monkeypox and heighten the suspicion topromptly detect, isolate and treat more cases to halt transmission.

AB  - Introduction: In an effort to combat SARS-CoV-2 through multi-subunit vaccinedesign, during studies using whole genome and immunome, ORF10, located at the 3' end of the genome, displayed unique features. It showed no homology to any known protein in other organisms, including SARS-CoV. It was observed that itsnucleotide sequence is 100% identical in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes sourcedworldwide, even in the recent-most VoCs and VoIs of B.1.1.529 (Omicron), B.1.617 (Delta), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) lineages, implicatingits constant nature throughout the evolution of deadly variants. Aim: Thestructure and function of SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 and the role it may play in the viral evolution is yet to be understood clearly. The aim of this study is to predictits structure, function, and understand evolutionary dynamics on the basis ofmutations and likely heightened immune responses in the immunopathogenesis ofthis deadly virus. Methods: Sequence analysis, ab-initio structure modeling andan understanding of the impact of likely substitutions in key regions of protein was carried out. Analyses of viral T cell epitopes and primary anchor residuemutations was done to understand the role it may play in the evolution as amolecule with likely enhanced immune response and consequent immunopathogenesis. Results: Few amino acid substitution mutations are observed, most probably due tothe ribosomal frameshifting, and these mutations may not be detrimental to itsfunctioning. As ORF10 is observed to be an expressed protein, ab-initio structuremodeling shows that it comprises mainly an alpha-helical region and maybe anER-targeted membrane mini-protein. Analyzing the whole proteome, it is observedthat ORF10 presents amongst the highest number of likely promiscuous andimmunogenic CTL epitopes, specifically 11 out of 30 promiscuous ones and 9 out ofthese 11, immunogenic CTL epitopes. Reactive T cells to these epitopes have been uncovered in independent studies. Majority of these epitopes are located on thealpha-helix region of its structure, and the substitution mutations of primaryanchor residues in these epitopes do not affect immunogenicity. Its conservednucleotide sequence throughout the evolution and diversification of virus intoseveral variants is a puzzle yet to be solved. Conclusions: On the basis of itssequence, structure, and epitope mapping, it is concluded that it may functionlike those mini-proteins used to boost immune responses in medical applications. Due to the complete nucleotide sequence conservation even a few years afterSARS-CoV-2 genome was first sequenced, it poses a unique puzzle to be solved, in view of the evolutionary dynamics of variants emerging in the populationsworldwide.

AB  - Enterovirus A (EV-A) species cause hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD),threatening the health of young children. Understanding the mutual codon usagepattern of the virus and its host(s) has fundamental and applied values. Here,through examining multiple codon usage parameters, we found that the codon usage bias among EV-A strains varies and is clade-specific. EVA76, EVA89, EVA90, EVA91 and EVA92, the unconventional clade of EV-A strains, show unique codon usagepattern relative to the two conventional clades, including EVA71, CVA16, CVA6 andCVA10, etc. Analyses of Effective Number of Codon (ENC), Correspondence Analysis (COA) and Parity Rule 2 (PR2), etc., revealed that the codon usage patterns ofEV-A strains are shaped by mutation pressure and natural selection. Based on the neutrality analysis, we determined the dominant role of natural selection in the formation of the codon usage bias of EV-A. In addition, we have determined thecodon usage compatibility of potential hosts for EV-A strains using codonadaptation index (CAI), relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI) and similarityindex (SiD) analyses, and found that EV-A showed host-specific codon adaptationpatterns in different clades. Finally, we confirmed that the unique codon usagepattern of the unconventional clade affected protein expression level in humancell lines. In conclusion, we identified novel characteristics of codon usagebias in distinct EV-A clades associated with their host range, transmission andpathogenicity.

AB  - Identification of the main SARS-CoV-2 variants in real time is of interest tocontrol the virus and to rapidly devise appropriate public health responses. The RT-qPCR is currently considered to be the reference method to screen SARS-CoV-2mutations, but it has some limitations. The multiplexing capability is limitedwhen the number of markers to detect increases. Moreover, the performance of thisallele-specific method may be impacted in the presence of new mutations. Herein, we present a proof-of-concept study of a simple molecular assay to detect keySARS-CoV-2 mutations. The innovative features of the assay are the multiplexasymmetric one-step RT-PCR amplification covering different regions of SARS-CoV-2S gene and the visual detection of mutations on a lateral flow DNA microarray.Three kits (Kit 1: N501Y, E484K; Kit 2: L452R, E484K/Q; Kit 3: K417N, L452R,E484K/Q/A) were developed to match recommendations for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2variants between January and December 2021. The clinical performance was assessedusing RNA extracts from 113 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples with cycle thresholds<30, and results demonstrated that our assay allows specific and sensitivedetection of mutations, with a performance comparable to that of RT-qPCR. TheVAR-CoV assay detected four SARS-CoV-2 targets and achieved specific andsensitive screening of spike mutations associated with the main variants ofconcern, with a performance comparable to that of RT-qPCR. With well-definedvirus sequences, this assay can be rapidly adapted to other emerging mutations;it is a promising tool for variant surveillance.

AB  - Upon acute viral infection, virus-specific CD4(+) T cells differentiate intoeither TH1 cells or follicular helper T (TFH) cells. The molecular pathwaysgoverning such bimodal cell fate commitment remain elusive. Additionally,effector virus-specific TFH cells further differentiate into corresponding memorypopulation, which confer long-term protection against re-infection of sameviruses by providing immediate help to virus-specific memory B cells. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the long-term maintenance of memory TFH cellsare largely unknown. In this review, we discuss current understanding of earlydifferentiation of virus-specific effector TFH cells and long-term maintenance ofvirus-specific memory TFH cells in mouse models of viral infection and patientsof the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical application and related influencing factors ofmetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in patients with sepsis inintensive care unit (ICU). Methods: The study included 124 patients with severesepsis admitted to the ICU in the First Affiliated Hospital of ZhengzhouUniversity from June 2020 to September 2021. Two experienced clinicians tookblood mNGS and routine blood cultures of patients meeting the sepsis diagnosticcriteria within 24 hours after sepsis was considered, and collection the general clinical data. Results: mNGS positive rate was higher than traditional bloodculture (67.74% vs. 19.35%). APACHE II score [odds ratio (OR)=1.096],immune-related diseases (OR=6.544), and hypertension (OR=2.819) were consideredas positive independent factors for mNGS or culture-positive. The sequence numberof microorganisms and pathogen detection (mNGS) type had no effect on prognosis. Age (OR=1.016), female (OR=5.963), myoglobin (OR=1.005), and positive virusresult (OR=8.531) were independent risk factors of sepsis mortality. Adjustingantibiotics according to mNGS results, there was no statistical difference in theprognosis of patients with sepsis. Conclusion: mNGS has the advantages of rapidand high positive rate in the detection of pathogens in patients with severesepsis. Patients with high APACHE II score, immune-related diseases, andhypertension are more likely to obtain positive mNGS results. The effect ofadjusting antibiotics according to mNGS results on the prognosis of sepsis needs to be further evaluated.

LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.945865 [doi]
AB  - Stress in poultry can lead to changes in body metabolism and immunity, which can increase susceptibility to infectious diseases. However, knowledge regardingchicken responses to viral infection under stress is limited. Dexamethasone (Dex)is a synthetic glucocorticoid similar to that secreted by animals under stressconditions, and has been widely used to induce stress in chickens. Herein, weestablished a stress model in 7-day-old chickens injected with Dex to elucidatethe effects of stress on IBV replication in the kidneys. The metabolic changes,immune status and growth of the chickens under stress conditions werecomprehensively evaluated. Furthermore, the metabolic profile, weight gain, viralload, serum cholesterol levels, cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte ratiowere compared in chickens treated with Dex and infected with IBV. AnLC-MS/MS-based metabolomics method was used to examine differentially enrichedmetabolites in the kidneys. A total of 113 metabolites whose abundance wasaltered after Dex treatment were identified, most of which were lipids andlipid-like molecules. The principal metabolic alterations in chicken kidneyscaused by IBV infection included fatty acid, valine, leucine and isoleucinemetabolism. Dex treatment before and after IBV infection mainly affected thehost's tryptophan, phenylalanine, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Inaddition, Dex led to up-regulation of serum cholesterol levels and renal viralload in chickens, and to the inhibition of weight gain, peripheral bloodlymphocytes and IL-6 production. We also confirmed that the exogenous cholesterolin DF-1 cells promoted the replication of IBV. However, whether the increase inviral load in kidney tissue is associated with the up-regulation of cholesterollevels induced by Dex must be demonstrated in future experiments. In conclusion, chick growth and immune function were significantly inhibited by Dex. Hostcholesterol metabolism and the response to IBV infection are regulated by Dex.This study provides valuable insights into the molecular regulatory mechanisms inpoultry stress, and should support further research on the intrinsic link betweencholesterol metabolism and IBV replication under stress conditions.

AB  - The white spot syndrome virus is the most destructive virus threatening theshrimp industry worldwide, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in economiclosses each year. There is currently no specific medicine to treat it. Therefore,rapid and accurate detection of WSSV is of great significance for controlling itsspread and reducing economic losses. Traditional detection methods, such aspolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative fluorescent PCR, rely onlaboratory equipment and are not suitable for field testing. In this study,recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with a lateral flow strip(LFS) was developed. This method targets the entire genome and designs primersand probes accordingly. The detection can be completed in 30 min at 37 degrees C,and the detection limit of each reaction is 20 copies, which is much moresensitive than other detection methods. The RPA-LFS method is highly specific to the white spot syndrome virus and has no cross-reactivity with other commonshrimp viruses or pathogens. In total, 100 field samples were tested and comparedto the real-time PCR method. Both methods detected 8 positive results, and thepositive detection rate was 100%. The method was fast, simple, specific, andsensitive. It does not rely on laboratory equipment and has broad applicationprospects for in-field detection, especially in remote areas with underdeveloped medical equipment.

AB  - The cotton blue disease, caused by the cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV), leadsto dwarfism, leaf rolling, and production loss in susceptible cotton varieties.To develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to detect the virus in cotton and weeds, peptides based on the coat protein were used to producepolyclonal (alpha-GQE, alpha-PRN, and alpha-INK) and monoclonal (alpha-GQE,alpha-PRN, and alpha-NKF) antibodies. All six were tested as capture antibodies, and polyclonal alpha-GQE and the monocle onal alpha-NKF were labeled with theenzyme alkaline phosphatase and used as detection antibodies for a doubleantibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA method, in which p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added and measured by absorbance at 405 nm. The DAS-ELISA sandwich was efficient indiscriminating between healthy and diseased plant extracts. The ELISA methodologydetected the virus in the weeds Commelina sp., which was confirmed by RT-PCR. Themonoclonal antibodies may be used to develop other diagnostic procedures.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.931392 [doi]
AB  - Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) allowssensitive detection of viral particles and viruses in epidemic samples but itcannot discriminate noninfectious viruses from infectious ones. Propidiummonoazide (PMA) coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) wasassessed to detect infectious viruses. Currently, there is no established testmethod to detect the infection of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). In this study, propidium monoazide coupled with qPCR detects infectivity of PEDV. Weoptimized the method from the selection of primers, the working concentration of PMA, and the inactivation method using heat or ultraviolet (UV). The viruseswhich were treated with PMA before qPCR were inactivated using heat or UV.However, the addition of PMA alone did not affect the detection of live viruses, which indicates that a viral capsid break may be essential for PMA to bind to thegenome. A repetition of the method on naked PEDV RNA suggests that it can be usedto detect potentially infectious PEDV. The results indicated that an optimal planof PMA could be extremely useful for evaluating infectious and noninfectiousviruses.

AB  - Outbreaks of influenza D virus (IDV) continue to be reported in many countries.On the basis of the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) gene, five IDV geneticlineages have been identified: D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, D/Yama2019 and D/CA2019lineages. Previously reported IDV strains in China all form a sub-clade (D/China sub-lineage) within D/OK lineage. From October 2021 to February 2022, nasal swab samples (n = 250) were collected from apparently healthy cattle inslaughterhouses around the city of Guangzhou, China, and screened for IDV byRT-PCR. Ten samples were positive for IDV. An IDV strain with nearly completegenome sequences was identified and designated as D/bovine/CHN/JY3001/2021.Importantly, sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses revealed that this IDVstrain is genetically close to the strains (>98% homology) in the D/Yama2019lineage that has been found only in Japan, but distant from the previouslyreported Chinese IDV strains (~95% similarity). These results demonstrate theemergence of D/Yama2019 lineage IDV in Chinese cattle herds, highlighting a need for future surveillance of D/Yama2019-like viruses toward better understandingboth epidemiology and diversity of IDV in China.

AB  - Bovine rotavirus A (boRVA) strains are common causative agents of diarrhea incalves, resulting in economic losses to the beef and dairy industry. Importantly,this virus has a zoonotic relevance due to its ability to reassort with humanrotaviruses. In this study, fecal samples were collected from three calves withdiarrhea during an outbreak on a dairy farm. The genetic material of boRVA wasdetected by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rtPCR) in two samples. Then the virus in one of these positive samples was identified as a novel boRVA genotypeclosely related with human rotavirus strains mainly from the USA based onwhole-genome characterization. However, we consider the novel boRVA as theetiological agent of the outbreak due to the lesions associated with a rotavirus infection. Further studies are necessary to clarify the evolutionary advantagesthat novel rotavirus genotypes may have.

LID - 10.1063/5.0101740 [doi]
AB  - Shearing DNA to a certain size is the first step in many medical and biologicalapplications, especially in next-generation gene sequencing technology. In thisarticle, we introduced a highly efficient ultrasonic DNA fragmentation methodenhanced by needle-induced air bubbles, which is easy to operate with highthroughput. The principle of the bubble-enhanced sonication system is introduced and verified by flow field and acoustic simulations and experiments. Lambda DNAlong chains and mouse genomic DNA short chains are used in the experiments fortesting the performance of the bubble-enhanced ultrasonic DNA fragmentationsystem. Air bubbles are an effective enhancement agent for ultrasonic DNAfragmentation; they can obviously improve the sound pressure level in the wholesolution, thus, achieving better absorption of ultrasound energy. Growing bubblesalso have a stretched function on DNA molecule chains and form a huge pressuregradient in the solution, which is beneficial to DNA fragmentation. PurifiedlambdaDNA is cut from 48.5 to 2 kbp in 5 min and cut to 300 bp in 30 min. Mousegenomic DNA ( approximately 1400 bp) decreases to 400 bp in 5 min and thenreduces to 200 bp in 30 min. This bubble-enhanced ultrasonic method enableswidespread access to genomic DNA fragmentation in a standard ultrasonic waterbath for many virus sequencing demands even without good medical facilities.

AB  - Objective: To slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, many countries have instituted preventive approaches (masks, social distancing) as well as the distribution ofvaccines. Adherence to these preventive measures is crucial to the success ofcontrolling the pandemic but decreased perceptions of disease severity couldlimit adherence. The aim of our study was to observe changes in perceivedpersonal severity and perceived community severity; the study also explored theirpredictors. Methods: In a longitudinal study from an address-based probabilitysurvey in Detroit, we asked participants to rate their perceived severity ofCOVID-19 for themselves and for their community. In our analysis, 746participants were queried across 5 waves of the Detroit Metro Area CommunitiesStudy surveys from March 31 to October 27 in 2020. We tested for trends inchanges of self-reported perceived severity for themselves and for theircommunity; we assessed the effects of different predictors of the two severities through mixed effects logistic regression models. Results: Our results highlight that the overall levels of perceived community and personal severity weredecreasing over time even though both severities were fluctuating with risingconfirmed case counts. Compared with non-Hispanic (NH) White Detroiters, NH BlackDetroiters reported a higher perceived personal severity (OR: 5.30, 95% CI: 2.97,9.47) but both groups reported similar levels of perceived community severity. Wefound steeper declines in perceived severity in NH White than NH Black Detroitersover time; the impact of education and income on perceived severity wasattenuated in NH Black Detroiters compared with NH White Detroiters. Conclusions:Our findings suggested that perceived severity for COVID-19 decreased throughtime and was affected by different factors among varied racial/ethnic groups.Future interventions to slow the pace of the pandemic should take into accountperceived personal and community severities among varied ethnic/racial subgroups.

PG  - 100137

AB  - Increasing incidence of fungal infections of recent times requires immediateintervention. Fungal infections are seldom construed at initial stages thatintensify the severity of infections and complicate the treatment procedures.Fungal pathogens employ various mechanisms to evade the host immune system and toprogress the severity of infections. For the treatment of diverse superficial andsystemic infections, antifungal drugs from the available repertoire areadministered. However, well documented evidence of fungal resistance to most ofthe antifungal drugs hampers disease control and poses challenges in antifungaltherapy. Several physiological adaptations and genetic mutations followed bytheir selection in presence of antifungal agents drive the resistance developmentin fungi. The availability of limited antifungal arsenal, emergence of resistanceand biofilm-conferred resistance drives the need for development of novel drugsand alternate approaches for the better treatment outcome against mycoses. Thisgraphical review explicitly shed light on various fungal infections and causativeorganisms, pathogenesis, different antifungal drugs and resistance mechanismsincluding host immune response and evasion strategies. Here, we have highlighted recent developments on novel antifungal agents and other alternate approaches forfighting against fungal infections.

AB  - Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes highly contagious respiratoryreproductive and renal system diseases in chickens, and emergence of serotypicvariants resulting from mutations in the viral S gene hampers vaccine management for IBV infection. In this study, to facilitate the molecular analysis of IBVpathogenesis and the development of a new-generation IBV vaccine, we established a reverse genetics system (RGS) for cloning the full-length cDNA of the IBVC-78E128 attenuated strain in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). TheBAC-cloned C-78E128 cDNA generated infectious viruses with biological properties of the parental C-78E128 strain with regard to an avirulent phenotype, tissuetropism and induction of virus neutralizing (VN) antibody in vivo. To assess the feasibility of genetic manipulation of the IBV genome using the BAC-based RGS,the S gene of the BAC-cloned C-78E128 cDNA was replaced with that of the IBVS95E4 virulent strain, which differs from the C-78E128 strain in serotype andtissue tropism, by bacteriophage lambda Red-mediated homologous recombination in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The resultant S gene recombinant virus was found tobe avirulent and fully competent to induce a serotype-specific VN antibodyagainst the S95 strain; however, the S gene recombinant virus did not fullyrecapitulate the tissue tropism of the S95E4 strain. These data imply thatserotype-specific VN immunogenicity, but not tissue-tropism and pathogenicity, ofIBV is determined by the viral S gene. The IBV BAC-based RGS that enables cloningand manipulation of the IBV virus genome entirely in E. coli provides a usefulplatform for the molecular analyses of IBV pathogenesis and the development ofrationally designed IBV recombinant vaccines.

TI  - Suppression of influenza virus infection by rhinovirus interference - at thepopulation, individual and cellular levels.
PG  - 100147
LID - 10.1016/j.crmicr.2022.100147 [doi]
AB  - Background: Influenza virus (IV) and the rhinovirus (RV) are the two most common circulating respiratory viruses circulating. Natural viral interference has been suggested between them. The effect of such at the population level has beendescribed in temperate region, while its effect at the individual and cellularlevels warrants further validation. In this study, we described the respiratoryvirus epidemiology and the co-infection landscape in the hospitalized population and investigated the distinct molecular pathways involved in the inhibition ofvirus replication. Methods: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) collected frompatients during 2015 to 2019 were examined for the presence of respiratoryviruses. The correlation of the monthly prevalence between all the testedrespiratory viruses, the co-infection rate and the temporal interference of RVand IV were tested. The viral interference was validated in vitro by conductingsequential RV and IV infections in the well-differentiated primary human airwayepithelial cells. The contributing molecular pathways were determined bytranscriptome analysis. Findings: A total of 112,926 NPAs were evaluated, and theEnterovirus/RV was the most prevalent respiratory virus detected. The negativecorrelation between EV/RV and IVs prevalence was independent of age andmeteorological factors. Compare with other viruses, EV/RV had a significantlylower incidence of co-infection with IVs. Prior exposure to RV inhibited thereplication of IV species A, B and oseltamivir-resistance stain in vitro. RVuniquely downregulated genes related to processing of viral mRNA, ribosomalproteins, translation and influenza infection. Interpretation: Epidemiologicalsurveillance and the sequential infection in vitro suggested viral interferencebetween EV/RV and IV operates at the population, individual and cellular levels. Funding: This study was supported by the General Research Fund (Ref: 24107017 and14103119 to RWYC) and the Chinese University Direct Grant for Research (Ref:2019.073 to RWYC).

LID - 10.1007/s11191-022-00362-y [doi]
AB  - In the post-truth era, one challenge facing science education is the circulation of fake news that distorts the information available for decision-making onissues that have a scientific basis and are controversial for society. In thiswork, we aimed at designing a learning environment with the objective ofequipping students with skills that allow them to deal with socio-scientificissues (SSI) in an infodemic context. To this end, we proposed an educationalinnovation through design-based research, which was oriented to the treatment of information disseminated in the media and social networks related to COVID-19. Wedivided this information into four major constructs: virus and disease dynamics; pandemic and environmental crisis; hygiene and protocols; and vaccines, potentialsolutions, and pharmaceutical industry. On the basis of the activities of thedidactic sequence, which included class discussion, interviews with the immediateenvironment, audiovisual productions, and a final plenary, we identified criteriathat students applied to trust or not trust the circulating information and aseries of strategies to corroborate the information. In addition, framingCOVID-19 as an SSI allowed the discussion of curricular content in science and onsociocultural dimensions that cross the pandemic. Based on the implementation of the teaching-learning sequence, we conclude that the proposed activities favored reflection on critical thinking and awareness of the responsibilities they haveas potential disseminators and/or generators of information.

LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.938633 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Evidence points to viral infections as possible triggers ofautoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), but little is known about the prevalence ofcommon viruses in the thyroid gland. Using a novel approach based on virusenrichment in multiple cell lines followed by detection of the viral genome andvisualization of viral proteins, we investigated the presence of multiple humanviruses in thyroid tissue from AITD patients and controls. Methods: Thyroidtissue was collected by core needle biopsy or during thyroid surgery from 35patients with AITD (20 Graves' disease and 15 Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Eighteen thyroid tissue specimens from patients undergoing neck surgery for reasons other than thyroid autoimmunity served as controls. Specimens were tested for thepresence of ten different viruses. Enteroviruses and human herpesvirus 6 wereenriched in cell culture before detection by PCR and immunofluorescence, whilethe remaining viruses were detected by PCR of biopsied tissue. Results: Forty of 53 cases (75%) carried an infectious virus. Notably, 43% of all cases had asingle virus, whereas 32% were coinfected by two or more virus types. Anenterovirus was found in 27/53 cases (51%), human herpesvirus 6 in 16/53 cases(30%) and parvovirus B19 in 12/53 cases (22%). Epstein-Barr virus andcytomegalovirus were found in a few cases only. Of five gastroenteric virusgroups examined, only one was detected in a single specimen. Virus distributionwas not statistically different between AITD cases and controls. Conclusion:Common human viruses are highly prevalent in the thyroid gland. This is the firststudy in which multiple viral agents have been explored in thyroid. It remains tobe established whether the detected viruses represent causal agents, possiblecofactors or simple bystanders.

PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1007/s13206-022-00076-x [doi]
AB  - One-step homogeneous immunoassay was developed for detecting influenza viruses A and B (Inf-A and Inf-B) using the switching peptide H2. As thefluorescence-labeled switching peptide dissociated from the binding pocket ofdetection antibodies, the fluorescence signal could be directly generated by the binding of Inf-A and Inf-B without washing (i.e., one-step immunoassay). For the one-step homogeneous immunoassay with detection antibodies in solution, graphene was labeled with the antibodies as a fluorescence quencher. To test thefeasibility of the homogeneous one-step immunoassay, the stability of theantibody complex with the switching peptide was evaluated under different pH and salt conditions. The one-step homogeneous immunoassay with switching peptide was conducted using influenza virus antigens in phosphate-buffered saline and realsamples with inactivated Inf-A and Inf-B spiked in serum. Finally, the one-stephomogeneous immunoassay results were compared with those of commerciallyavailable lateral flow immunoassays.

PG  - 345
LID - 10.11604/pamj.2022.41.345.33421 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: on January 7(th) 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was identified in Wuhan, China,and on March 11(th), 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a"Pandemic". The aim of this research is to assess depression, anxiety, work, and social status in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: theresearch was designed to be a cross-sectional face-to-face survey. The studyincluded 111 healthcare employees and 222 non-healthcare workers between the agesof 18 and 65 who applied to the hospital. For some reason, no one was excludedfrom the research. Socio-demographic and lifestyle-related questions, depression,anxiety, work-social adjustment scores, and pandemic-social status-operationconnections were all assessed using a self-report questionnaire containingpsychometric measures. Results: the mean age of the participants in the study was33.67+/-10.01 and 59% of the participants were female. PHQ9: 11.67+/-6.41, GAD7: 9.06+/-5.81, and W&SAS: 17.55+/-10.98 were the scores of the healthcareprofessional groups. PHQ9: 10.25+/-6.21, GAD7: 7.59+/-5.65, and W&SAS:14.75+/-10.27 were the non-healthcare professional groups' results. When thePHQ9, GAD7, and W&SAS scores of both groups were compared, there was nostatistically significant difference in the PHQ9 depression score between the twogroups (p=0.107), the GAD7 (p<0.05) and W&SAS (p<0.05) scores of the healthcareprofessionals were statistically significantly higher. Conclusion: in comparison to the non-healthcare worker group, healthcare professionals had the same levelof depression, greater levels of moderate and high anxiety, and higher levels of work-social adjustment disorder. Unlike the literature, we found that the degree of depression fell to the same level as the non-health professional group in our study, but it was still disadvantaged in terms of anxiety and work-socialadjustment.

TI  - Pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in the pulmonary function laboratory at atertiary government hospital in Qatar: A clinical audit.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.5339/qmj.2022.fqac.26 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior to pulmonary function testing (PFT), local and internationalrecommendations advise pre-procedural screening. Pulmonary function testsgenerate aerosol droplets containing millions of viruses, significantlyincreasing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) transmission not only to the individuals in and around the PFToffice, but also to subsequent patients who undergo the test later in the sameroom. METHODS: This clinical audit was carried out to establish the rate ofpositive pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing before a PFT. The data wereobtained over a 6-week period from our ATS accredited pulmonary functionlaboratory at the Hamad General Hospital, Qatar (December 01, 2021, to January10, 2022). The PFT laboratory was closed from January 10, 2022, till the date of this report (January 27, 2022) owing to an increase in COVID cases in thecommunity in Qatar during the fourth wave. RESULTS: All the patients scheduledfor PFT were asymptomatic of COVID-19. A total of 331 individuals were scheduled for PFT, and 221 PFTs were performed. There were 109 no-shows for both the PCRand the PFT. Between weeks 1 and 4, all the pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 PCR testswere negative. The weekly average number of COVID-19 cases in Qatar increasedfrom 157 per 100,000 population in week 1 to 2,918 in week 6.(2) There was asimilar trend in the pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests that increased andresulted in identifying 9 cases with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test over weeks 5and 6 (Figure 1). CONCLUSION: As the number of documented positive SARS-CoV-2 PCRtests in the community grew, so did the pre-procedural COVID-19 PCR positivityand the number of no-shows. The large number of no-shows may indicate greaterworry or concern about contracting COVID-19 when visiting the hospital amid peak community cases. Our findings further call into question the utility of routinelyperforming pre-procedural PCR screening in asymptomatic cases when the prevalenceof COVID-19 is low in the local population. Perhaps, it is time to considerreplacing this with on-the-spot quick antigen testing for more effective use ofresources.

TI  - Editorial: Long-Term Effects of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infectionin Children and the Changing Pathogenesis of Common Childhood Viruses Driven bythe COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - e937927
LID - 10.12659/MSM.937927 [doi]
AB  - The range of long-term clinical conditions following SARS-CoV-2 infection inadults is now recognized. However, the prevalence, presentation, and risk factorsfor long COVID, or post-COVID-19, in children are less well understood becausethere have been few follow-up studies or long-term clinical trials in childrenwith COVID-19. However, recent studies have shown that children with mild orasymptomatic COVID-19 may develop long-term sequelae that include cough, fatigue,and lethargy. The incidence and severity of common childhood respiratory viruses have changed in the past year, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Hepatitis of unknown cause in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection is increasingly reported. Although both a viral cause and an autoimmune cause have been proposed,adenovirus type 41 infection is of current interest. These findings supportimmunization programs for SARS-CoV-2 in children, and infection surveillance and monitoring of the changing patterns and severity of other pediatric viralinfections, including adenovirus type 41 and RSV, to develop and administereffective vaccines. This Editorial aims to highlight what is currently known ofthe long-term effects of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection inchildren and the changing epidemiology and pathogenesis of previously commonchildhood viral infections now driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Diagnostic Significance of Lactate Dehydrogenase in Measles Virus ReinfectionCases.
LID - 10.1111/1348-0421.13021 [doi]
AB  - Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in measles virus (MeV) reinfection cases forthe diagnosis of measles have not been extensively studied. Thus, we evaluatedthe significance of serum LDH in the immune response of patients with MeVreinfection in comparison with those of patients with primary infection. Among 70patients who tested positive for MeV-RNA, 42 with high MeV-specific IgG avidity(HA) were suspected as cases of reinfection and 28 with low MeV-specific IgG (LA)were suspected as cases of primary infection. The viral loads in the HA groupwere also lower than those in the LA group (p < 0.001). The titers ofMeV-specific IgM and IgG in the HA group were significantly lower and higher,respectively, than those in the LA group (p < 0.001). The total LDH and LDHisozyme levels were elevated in the LA group compared with those in the HA group (p < 0.001). Through receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, wedetermined that the area under the curve of total LDH level was 0.87 (95%confidence interval 0.74-1.00) and that the discriminatory accuracy was high for total LDH and all isozymes. By stepwise binary logistic regression analysisconsidering MeV-specific IgG avidity, we developed a model using IgG, IgM, andtotal LDH as explanatory variables, which was optimal for distinguishing the LAand HA groups (adjusted R(2) : 0.773, p < 0.001). Thus, the serum LDH level inaddition to IgM and IgG may be useful parameters for differentiating MeVreinfection from primary infection. This article is protected by copyright. Allrights reserved.

TI  - Application of nano drug loading systems in the treatment of neurologicalinfections: update review.
LID - 10.2174/1381612828666220728092336 [doi]
AB  - Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is a global healthcare concern withhigh rates of death and disease. CNS infections mainly include meningitis,encephalitis, and brain abscesses. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, andparasites are the most common causes of neuroinfections.There are many types ofmedications used in the treatment of CNS infections, but drug delivery throughthe blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major challenge to be overcome. The BBB is aspecialized multicellular barrier separating the neural tissue from theperipheral blood circulation. Unique characteristics of the BBB allow it totightly control the movement of ions and molecules.Thus, there is a critical needto deal with these conditions with the aim of improving novel antimicrobialagents. Researchers are still struggling to find effective drugs to treat CNSinfections. Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated drug delivery has been considered as aprofound substitute to solve this problem, because NPs can be tailored tofacilitate drug transport across the BBB. NPs are colloidal systems with a sizerange of 1-1000 nm which can be used to encapsulate therapeutics, improve drugtransport across the BBB, and target specific brain areas in CNS infections. Awide variety of NPs have been displayed for the CNS delivery of therapeutics,especially when their surfaces are coated with targeting moieties. The presentpaper aimed to review the available literature on the application of NPs in CNSinfections.

TI  - Epidemiological surveillance of Newcastle disease virus in Egypt - a 6-yearcohort study.
PG  - 243
LID - 10.1007/s11250-022-03234-3 [doi]
AB  - Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important poultry diseases worldwideand can lead to annual losses of up to 80% of backyard chickens in Africa. Aretrospective cohort of 6 years was planned to screen the NDV in intensivechicken and turkey flocks. The existence of velogenic NDV strain was screened in different poultry flocks showing suspected signs of NDV using real-time RT-PCRtargeting the F gene of the velogenic strain. A total of 843 poultry flocks were screened during the cohort. Samples were classified based on the month and yearas well as the poultry type. All flocks should be negative for avian influenzavirus as an inclusion criterion of the study. The F gene of a randomly selectedpositive sample from each year as well as an archival sample from 2005 wassequenced. An overall of 52.4% (443/842) of the tested farms showed positiveresults for the velogenic NDV. The cumulative percentage of positive flocks tothe total positive flocks per month ranged from 5.9 to 11.8%. The resultsrevealed that NDV is circulating across all months annually without evidence ofseasonal tendency of the disease. Most of the strains belong to genotype VII.1.1,with only two strains related to XXI.1.1 and XXI.2. All VII.1.1 strains possessarginine at 27 position while XXI.1.1 and XXI.2 strains showed cysteine at 27 andamino acid substitutions in the signal peptide, cleavage site, and neutralizingepitopes. In conclusion, the current molecular epidemiological surveillanceconfirms the enzootic nature of NDV. It circulates all year round with noevidence of seasonal incidence. Genotype VII is the most predominant NDV genotypein Egypt.

LID - 10.1007/s00011-022-01612-z [doi]
AB  - Among the countless endeavours made at elucidating the pathogenesis of COVID-19, those aimed at the histopathological alterations of type 2 alveolar epithelialcells (AT2) are of outstanding relevance to the field of lung physiology, as theyare the building blocks of the pulmonary alveoli. A merit of high regenerativeand proliferative capacity, exocytotic activity resulting in the release ofextracellular vesicles (EVs) is particularly high in AT2 cells, especially inthose infected with SARS-CoV-2. These AT2 cell-derived EVs, containing thegenetic material of the virus, might enter the bloodstream and make their wayinto the cardiovascular system, where they may infect cardiomyocytes and bringabout a series of events leading to heart failure. As surfactant protein C, amarker of AT2 cell activity and a constituent of the lung surfactant complex,occurs abundantly inside the AT2-derived EVs released during the inflammatorystage of COVID-19, it could potentially be used as a biomarker for predictingimpending heart failure in those patients with a history of cardiovasculardisease.

LID - 10.1542/peds.2021-055896 [doi]
AB  - Over a century of research has focused on improving our understanding ofcongenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV), yet it remains the most common congenitalinfection in the United States, affecting 3 to 6 per 1000 live born infants each year. Pregnancies affected by cCMV are at a heightened risk of spontaneousabortion and intrauterine fetal demise. Neonates born with cCMV are also atsubstantial risk for long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae and disability,including sensorineural hearing loss, even those born without clinically apparentdisease. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in study of theepidemiology and transmission of cCMV, developing better diagnostic strategies,implementing newborn screening programs, improving therapeutics, and launchingvaccine trials. In this article, we review recent developments in theunderstanding of the virology and immunobiology of cytomegalovirus. We furtherdiscuss how this knowledge informs our understanding of the pathophysiology ofcCMV and directs strategies aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life forcongenitally infected children. We also provide an update on the epidemiology of cCMV in the United States, evolving scientific understanding of maternal-fetaltransmission, enhanced screening approaches, and recognition of neonatal andlong-term sequelae. Finally, we review the current landscape of pediatric cCMVresearch and provide recommendations for novel and high-priority areas for futureinvestigation.

TI  - TRIM18 is a critical regulator of viral myocarditis and organ inflammation.
PG  - 55
LID - 10.1186/s12929-022-00840-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections by viruses including severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 could cause organ inflammations such as myocarditis, pneumonia and encephalitis. Innate immunity to viral nucleic acids mediates antiviral immunity as well as inflammatory organ injury. However, the innate immune mechanisms that control viral induced organ inflammations are unclear. METHODS: To understand therole of the E3 ligase TRIM18 in controlling viral myocarditis and organinflammation, wild-type and Trim18 knockout mice were infected withcoxsackievirus B3 for inducing viral myocarditis, influenza A virus PR8 strainand human adenovirus for inducing viral pneumonia, and herpes simplex virus type I for inducing herpes simplex encephalitis. Mice survivals were monitored, andheart, lung and brain were harvested for histology and immunohistochemistryanalysis. Real-time PCR, co-immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay, luciferase assay, flow cytometry, over-expression andknockdown techniques were used to understand the molecular mechanisms of TRIM18in regulating type I interferon (IFN) production after virus infection in thisstudy. RESULTS: We find that knockdown or deletion of TRIM18 in human or mousemacrophages enhances production of type I IFN in response to double strand (ds)RNA and dsDNA or RNA and DNA virus infection. Importantly, deletion of TRIM18protects mice from viral myocarditis, viral pneumonia, and herpes simplexencephalitis due to enhanced type I IFN production in vivo. Mechanistically, weshow that TRIM18 recruits protein phosphatase 1A (PPM1A) to dephosphorylate TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which inactivates TBK1 to block TBK1 from interactingwith its upstream adaptors, mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) andstimulator of interferon genes (STING), thereby dampening antiviral signalingduring viral infections. Moreover, TRIM18 stabilizes PPM1A by inducing K63-linkedubiquitination of PPM1A. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that TRIM18 serves as a negative regulator of viral myocarditis, lung inflammation and brain damage by downregulating innate immune activation induced by both RNA and DNA viruses. Our data reveal that TRIM18 is a critical regulator of innate immunity in viralinduced diseases, thereby identifying a potential therapeutic target fortreatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a variety of infections in humans, such as burn wound infections and infections of the lungs, the bloodstream and surgical site infections. Nosocomial spread isoften concurrent with high degrees of antibiotic resistance. Such resistantstrains are difficult to treat, and in some cases, even reserved antibiotics are ineffective. A particularly promising therapy to combat infections of resistantbacteria is the deployment of bacteriophages, known as phage therapy. In thiswork, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of two Pseudomonas phages in bacteremiamice models. For this study, non-neutropenic mice (BalB/C) were infected with P. aeruginosa AB030 strain and treated using two bacteriophages, AP025 and AP006.RESULTS: The results showed that a single dose of phages at higherconcentrations, bacteria: phage at 1:10 and 1:100 were effective in eliminatingthe bloodstream infection and achieving 100% mice survival. CONCLUSION: Thisstudy highlights the efficacy of using a single dose of phages to restore micefrom bacteremia.

TI  - Perceptions and experiences of sexual violence among Chinese men who have sexwith men in Hong Kong.
LID - 10.1111/jan.15391 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to understand the perceptions and experiences of sexualviolence among Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) in Hong Kong. DESIGN: The study adopted a qualitative descriptive design with thematic analysis. METHODS:Thirty-one Chinese MSM were recruited in Hong Kong from May to June 2019 usingpurposive sampling. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with theparticipants. The interview data were transcribed verbatim from the recordingsand analysed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Fourthemes were identified: (1) different forms of sexual violence, from physical to virtual; (2) inner struggles with fears and worry; (3) low awareness andperceived risk of sexual violence - 'it has nothing to do with me' and (4)dilemma towards sexual violence prevention. CONCLUSION: The study providedqualitative evidence regarding the experiences and perceptions of sexual violenceamong Chinese MSM in Hong Kong. Physical and image-based forms of sexual violencewere identified, which led the participants to experience psychological distress,fear of contracting human immunodeficiency virus/other sexually transmittedinfections, notoriety within the gay community, and discrimination andstigmatization within their family and workplace. To reduce the risk of sexualviolence, some participants were cautious about the venue in which they engagedin sex and the habit of sharing sexually explicit photos with others. However,some participants had low awareness and perceived risk of sexual violence.IMPACTS: This study was the first to fill the research gap on sexual violenceissues among Chinese MSM using dating apps in Hong Kong. The qualitative findingsenhanced the scholarly understanding of Chinese MSM's perceptions and experiencesof sexual violence. The study findings can help nursing staff and otherhealthcare professionals to develop tailored primary, secondary and tertiarysexual violence prevention programmes for MSM or beyond.

AB  - Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and central neurogenichyperventilation (CNH) are both rare occurrences, especially when associated withEpstein-Barr Virus (EBV). We report a case of an immunocompetent individual whopresented to the emergency department (ED) with vague neurological symptoms foundto have an EBV-associated PCNSL complicated by CNH. This rare occurrence had aninsidious presentation initially mistaken for "post-concussive syndrome" at anoutside ED. Insidious neurological malignancies, posterior strokes, intracranial hematomas, and other life-threatening pathologies should always be on thedifferential in patients presenting to the ED with falls with associatedneurological symptoms, especially with unexplained blood gas abnormalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An increased number of older recipients underwent livertransplantation in recent years, and consequently needing to obtain more livergrafts. In order to increase this pool, in 2006, we initiated the use of liversfrom uncontrolled circulatory death (uDCD). We analyzed the use of uDCD livers insexagenarian recipients and their effect on overall survival. METHODS: Aretrospective and comparative study was performed among 4 groups according torecipient age (less or greater than 60 years) and donor type (donor brain death[DBD] or uDCD): Group A: DBD livers in recipients aged <60 years (n = 169); GroupB: uDCD livers in recipients aged <60 years (n = 36); Group C: DBD livers inrecipients aged >60 years (n = 96); and Group D: uDCD livers in recipients aged>60 years(n = 39). RESULTS: Intraoperative transfusion, biliary complications,primary non-function, acute rejection, chronic renal dysfunction,retransplantation, and mortality during follow-up (cardiovascular diseases in 3patients, hepatitis C virus recurrence in 4 patients, and de novo malignancies in3 patients) were significantly higher, and 5-year patient and graft survival was significantly lower in sexagenarian recipients. Bilirubin and packed red bloodcells transfusion were risk factors for patient survival, whereas hepatocelularcarcinoma, creatinine, and packed red blood cells transfusion were risk factorsfor patient survival. Recipient age (<60 years) was confirmed as protectivefactor for patient and graft survival, whereas the use of uDCD was not a riskfactor for patient or graft survival. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a uDCD liver did notdemonstrate as a risk factor for patient and graft survival, and recipient age(<60 years) was a protective factor for patient and graft survival.

AB  - Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder with involvement of the donorurogenital tissue is a rare and serious complication of solid organ transplant.We report an adult kidney transplant recipient who developed the diffuse large B cell lymphoma of the distal ureter in the setting of new allograft nephropathy.Early intervention, reduction of immunosuppression, surgical reconstruction andchemotherapy salvaged the allograft kidney and averted a fatal outcome. The renalfunction recovered to the baseline with creatinine ranging between 1.3 and 1.5.The patient did not require dialysis at any point after ureteral stent placement and reconstructive surgery. In addition, the case highlights the importance ofmultidisciplinary management involving transplant nephrology, oncology,transplant surgery, and urology in such a complicated disease process.

TI  - Bovine leukemia virus-associated B cell lymphoma with severe pleomorphism in asteer.
LID - 10.1292/jvms.21-0607 [doi]
AB  - We examined a 26-month-old steer with neoplastic lesions in the spleen, lymphnodes, heart and kidneys, characterized by pleomorphic lymphoid cells that wereimmunohistochemically positive for CD20. The presence of bovine leukemia virus(BLV) at >200,000 copies per 100,000 cells by quantitative RT-PCR was considered to be due to random integration of the provirus into the neoplastic cellsgenomes. Inverse PCR identified the presence of one, two, two and three differentmalignant clones in the heart, spleen, mesenteric node and blood, respectively.Because BLV can rapidly induce lymphoma and a high proviral load facilitatesB-cell carcinogenesis, multiclonal tumor development was suspected in the presentcase.

PG  - 1022-1026
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b22-00220 [doi]
AB  - The emu is the second largest ratite; thus, their sera and egg yolks, obtainedafter immunization, could provide therapeutic and diagnostically importantimmunoglobulins with improved production efficiency. Reliable purification tools are required to establish a pipeline for supplying practical emu-derivedantibodies, the majority of which belongs to the immunoglobulin Y (IgY) class.Therefore, we generated a monoclonal secondary antibody specific to emu IgY.Initially, we immunized an emu with bovine serum albumin multiply haptenized with2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) groups. Polyclonal emu anti-DNP antibodies were partiallypurified using conventional precipitation method and used as antigen forimmunizing a BALB/c mouse. Splenocytes were fused with myeloma cells and ahybridoma clone secreting a desirable secondary antibody (mAb#2-16) wasestablished. The secondary antibody bound specifically to emu-derived IgY,distinguishing IgYs from chicken, duck, ostrich, quail, and turkey, as well ashuman IgGs. Affinity columns immobilizing the mAb#2-16 antibodies enabledpurification of emu IgY fractions from sera and egg yolks via simple protocols,with which we succeeded in producing IgYs specific to the severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein with apractical binding ability. We expect that the presented purification method, and the secondary antibody produced in this study, will facilitate the utilization ofemus as a novel source of therapeutic and diagnostic antibodies.

TI  - Detection of Respiratory Viruses in SARS-CoV-2-Negative Specimens from January toMarch 2020 in Fukuoka, Japan.
LID - 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2022.079 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first cases confirmed in Japan on January 15,2020. The Fukuoka Institute of Health and Environmental Sciences conductedtesting by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 from January 31 toMarch 4, 2020. Despite collecting 119 samples from 81 patients with fever, cough,fatigue, pneumonia, and other symptoms who were suspected as having SARS-CoV-2infection, all samples tested during that period were negative. To investigatethe pathogens responsible for these symptoms, we conducted multiplex polymerasechain reaction. The results showed that respiratory viruses, humanmetapneumovirus (hMPV) was detected in 10 patients (12%), human rhinovirus (HRV) in 3 patients (4%), and influenza B virus in 1 patient (1%). In addition, thepatients found as having the viruses were significantly older than those notfound as having the viruses. Infection with hMPV and HRV has been reported to be associated with the risk of severe illness and death among the elderly.Therefore, differentiating SARS-CoV-2 as well as other respiratory viruses suchas hMPV and HRV is necessary to prevent and control the spread of infection,especially in the elderly.

LID - 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2021.841 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agentof coronavirus disease 2019, is spreading globally. In general, the viral genome becomes undetectable within a couple of weeks after infection. Herein, we report a case of long-term detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from the same individualfor 106 days. Whole genome sequencing was performed on specimens taken at theonset of the disease and at 2 months after onset, and the B.1.1.7 lineage wasdetected in both samples. Comparison of the full-length sequences revealed asingle-base difference and no amino acid mutations. This is the first case inJapan where the virus was detected over a long time, and the full-lengthsequences were compared.

LID - 10.5582/bst.2022.01333 [doi]
AB  - Two cases of the deadly Marburgvirus were reported in Ghana, which might be a newglobal virus alert following COVID-19 and novel monkeypox. Thus far, there is no vaccine or treatment for Marburg virus disease, which is a disease with amortality rate as high as that of Ebola. Although now human infections withMarburgvirus occurred mainly in Africa, outbreaks were twice reported in Europeover the past 55 years. A concern is that globalization might promote its global viral transmission, just like what happened with COVID-19. The current study has briefly summarized the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms of theMarburgvirus as well as vaccine development and experimental treatments in order to prevent and control this virus.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 vaccine safety in adolescents with inflammatory rheumatic andmusculoskeletal diseases and adults with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: data fromthe EULAR COVAX physician-reported registry.
LID - e002322 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/rmdopen-2022-002322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination safety in children and young people (CYP) with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs).Current vaccination guidance is based on data from adults with RMDs or CYPwithout RMDs. OBJECTIVES: To describe the safety of SARS-COV-2 vaccination inadolescents with inflammatory RMDs and adults with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: We described patient characteristics, flares and adverse events(AEs) in adolescent cases under 18 with inflammatory RMDs and adult cases aged 18or above with JIA submitted to the European Alliance of Associations forRheumatology COVAX registry. RESULTS: A total of 110 cases were reported to theregistry. Thirty-six adolescent cases were reported from four countries, mostwith JIA (42%). Over half (56%) reported early reactogenic-like AEs. One mildpolyarthralgia flare and one serious AE of special interest (malaise) werereported. No CYP reported SARS-CoV-2 infection postvaccination.Seventy-four adultJIA cases were reported from 11 countries. Almost two-thirds (62%) reported earlyreactogenic-like AEs and two flares were reported (mild polyarthralgia andmoderate uveitis). No serious AEs of special interest were reported among adults with JIA. Three female patients aged 20-30 years were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2postvaccination; all fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS: This is an importantcontribution to research on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine safety in adolescents with RMDsand adults with JIA. It is important to note the low frequency of disease flares,serious AEs and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection seen in both populations, although thedataset is limited by its size.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 and resulted in a pandemic causingmillions of infections worldwide. Gold-standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection usesquantitative RT-qPCR on respiratory secretions to detect viral RNA (vRNA).Acquiring these samples is invasive, can be painful for those with xerostomia andother health conditions, and sample quality can vary greatly. Frequently onlysymptomatic individuals are tested even though asymptomatic individuals can have comparable viral loads and efficiently transmit virus. METHODS: We utilized anon-invasive approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 in individuals, using polyvinylalcohol (PVA) strips embedded in KN95 masks. PVA strips were tested forSARS-CoV-2 vRNA via qRT-PCR and infectious virus. RESULTS: We show efficientrecovery of vRNA and infectious virus from virus-spiked PVA with detection limitscomparable to nasal swab samples. In infected individuals, we detect both humanand SARS-CoV-2 RNA on PVA strips, however, these levels are not correlated withlength of time mask was worn, number of times coughed or sneezed, or level ofvirus in nasal swab samples. We successfully cultured and deep-sequencedPVA-associated virus. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the feasibility ofusing PVA-embedded masks as a non-invasive platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2 inexhaled air in COVID-positive individuals regardless of symptom status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, reuse of personalprotective equipment, specifically that of medical face coverings, has beenrecommended. The reuse of these typically single-use only items necessitatesprocedures to inactivate contaminating human respiratory and gastrointestinalpathogens. We previously demonstrated decontamination of surgical masks andrespirators contaminated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 and various animalcoronaviruses via low concentration- and short exposure methylene bluephotochemical treatment (10 microM methylene blue, 30 minutes of 12,500-lux redlight or 50,000 lux white light exposure). METHODS: Here, we describe theadaptation of this protocol to the decontamination of a more resistant,non-enveloped gastrointestinal virus and demonstrate efficient photodynamicinactivation of murine norovirus, a human norovirus surrogate. RESULTS: Methyleneblue photochemical treatment (100 microM methylene blue, 30 minutes of 12,500-luxred light exposure) of murine norovirus-contaminated masks reduced infectiousviral titers by over four orders of magnitude on surgical mask surfaces.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of a norovirus, the most difficult toinactivate of the respiratory and gastrointestinal human viruses, can predict theinactivation of any less resistant viral mask contaminant. The protocol developedhere thus solidifies the position of methylene blue photochemical decontaminationas an important tool in the package of practical pandemic preparedness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a worldwide shortage of N95respirators, prompting the development of decontamination methods to enablelimited reuse. Countries lacking reliable supply chains would also benefit fromthe ability to safely reuse PPE. Methylene blue (MB) is a light-activated dyewith demonstrated antimicrobial activity used to sterilize blood plasma.Decontamination of respirators using photoactivated MB requires no specializedequipment, making it attractive for use in the field during outbreaks. METHODS:We examined decontamination of N95 and KN95 respirators using photoactivated MBand 3 variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19; and 4 World Health Organization priority pathogens: Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndromecoronavirus, Nipah virus, and Lassa virus. Virus inactivation by pretreatingrespirator material was also tested. RESULTS: Photoactivated MB inactivated alltested viruses on respirator material, albeit with varying efficiency. Virusapplied to respirator material pre-treated with MB was also inactivated, thus MB pretreatment may potentially protect respirator wearers from virus exposure inreal-time. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that photoactivated MBrepresents a cost-effective, rapid, and widely deployable method to decontaminateN95 respirators for reuse during supply shortages.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), asconsequence of the COVID-19 global pandemic, has unmasked significant resourceinequities prompting efforts to develop methods for safe PPE decontamination for reuse. The World Health Organization (WHO) in their Rational Use of PPE bulletin cited the use of a photodynamic dye, methylene blue, and light exposure as aviable option for N95 respirator decontamination. Because WHO noted thatmethylene blue (MB) would be applied to surfaces through which health careworkers breathe, we hypothesized that little to no MB will be detectable byspectroscopy when the PPE is subjected to MB at supraphysiologic airflow rates.METHODS: A panel of N95 respirators, medical masks, and cloth masks were sprayed with 5 cycles of 1,000 uM MB solution. Mask coupons were subjected to theequivalent of 120 L/min of 100% humidified air flow. Effluent gas was trapped in an aqueous solution and the resultant fluid was sampled for MB absorbance with a level of detection of 0.004 mg/m3. RESULTS: No detectable MB was identified forany mask using Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy. CONCLUSIONS: At 500-fold theamount of MB applied to N95 respirators and medical masks as were used for thedecontamination study cited in the WHO Rational Use of PPE bulletin, nodetectable MB was observed, thus providing safety evidence for the use ofmethylene blue and light exposure for mask decontamination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care inequity in remote and rural Indigenous communities ofteninvolves difficulty accessing health care services and supplies. Remotely PilotedAircraft Systems, or drones, offer a potentially cost-effective method forreducing inequity by removing geographic barriers, increasing timeliness, andimproving accessibility of supplies, equipment, and remote care. METHODS: Weassessed the feasibility of drones for delivery of supplies, medical equipment,and medical treatment across multiple platforms, including drone fleetdevelopment and testing; payload system integration (custom fixed-mount, winch,and parachute); and medical delivery simulations (COVID-19 test kit delivery and return, delivery of personal protective equipment, and remote ultrasound deliveryand testing). RESULTS: Drone operational development has led to a finalized,scalable fleet of small to large drones with functional standard operatingprocedures across a range of scenarios, and custom payload systems including afixed-mount, winch-based and parachute-based system. Simulation scenarios weresuccessful, with COVID-19 test swabs returned to the lab with no signaldegradation and a remote ultrasound successfully delivered and remotely guided inthe field. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Drone-based medical delivery models offer aninnovative approach to addressing longstanding issues of health care access andequity and are particularly relevant in the context of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methylene blue (MB) and riboflavin (RB) are light-activated dyes withdemonstrated antimicrobial activity. They require no specialized equipment,making them attractive for widespread use. Due to COVID-19-related worldwideshortages of surgical masks, simple, safe, and effective decontamination methods for reusing masks have become desirable in clinical and public settings. MATERIALAND METHODS: We examined the decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant onsurgical masks and Revolution-Zero Environmentally Sustainable (RZES) reusablemasks using these photoactivated dyes. We pre-treated surgical masks with 2 MBconcentrations, 2 RB concentrations, and 2 combinations of MB and RB. We alsotested 7 MB concentrations on RZES masks. RESULTS: Photoactivated MB consistentlyinactivated SARS-CoV-2 at >99.9% for concentrations of 2.6 microM or higherwithin 30 min on RZES masks and 5 microM or higher within 5 min on disposablesurgical masks. RB alone showed a lower, yet still significant inactivation (approximately 93-99%) in these conditions. DISCUSSION: MB represents acost-effective, rapid, and widely deployable decontamination method forSARS-CoV-2. The simplicity of MB formulation makes it ideal for maskpre-treatment in low-resource settings. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate thatMB effectively decontaminates SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations above 5 microM onsurgical masks and above 10 microM on RZES masks.

AB  - The citrus tatter leaf virus (CTLV) is one of the most destructive citrus viraldiseases worldwide. In this study, reverse transcription-recombinase polymeraseamplification combined with a lateral flow dipstick (RT-RPA-LFD) assay for rapid visual detection of CTLV was established. The assay was performed at 35 in 27min without specialised equipment. The RT-RPA-LFD assay showed high specificity toCTLV, and the sensitivity to CTLV was the same as that of quantitative RT-PCR at 3x10(3) copies/muL CTLV RNA transcripts. A total of 45 field tangor samples were tested using RT-RPA-LFD, RT-PCR, and RT-qPCR, and the results were consistent.The results demonstrated that the RT-RPA-LFD assay is a promising tool for rapid on-site CTLV detection.

AB  - Thermal cyclers are used to perform polymerase chain reaction runs (PCR runs) andPeltier modules are the key components in these instruments. The demand forthermal cyclers has strongly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to thefact that they are important tools used in the research, identification, anddiagnosis of the virus. Even though Peltier modules are quite durable, theirfailure poses a serious threat to the integrity of the instrument, which can leadto plant shutdowns and sample loss. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to predict the state of health of Peltier modules and thus reduce downtime. Inthis paper methods from three sub-categories of supervised machine learning,namely classical methods, ensemble methods and convolutional neural networks,were compared with respect to their ability to detect the state of health ofPeltier modules integrated in thermal cyclers. Device-specific data from on-deck thermal cyclers (ODTC(R)) supplied by INHECO Industrial Heating & Cooling GmbH(Fig 1), Martinsried, Germany were used as a database for training the models.The purpose of this study was to investigate methods for data-driven conditionmonitoring with the aim of integrating predictive analytics into future productplatforms. The results show that information about the state of health can beextracted from operational data - most importantly current readings - and thatconvolutional neural networks were the best at producing a generalized model for fault classification.

AB  - Relatively few viruses infecting haloarchaea (haloviruses) have been reported. Inthis study, the genome sequence of VOLN27B, a recently described archaeal tailed virus (arTV) with a myovirus morphotype was described, along with the sequence ofits host, Halorubrum spp. LN27. Halovirus VOLN27B contains a linear, dsDNA genomeof 76,891 bp which is predicted to encode 109 proteins and four tRNAs (tRNA(Thr),tRNA(Arg), tRNA(Gly) and tRNA(Asn)). The DNA G + C content of VOLN27B genome is56.1 mol%, nearly 10% lower than that of its host strain. A 315 bp LTR (longterminal repeat) was detected in the genome. The genome of its host strain LN27was 3,301,211 bp (chromosome and 1 plasmid) with a DNA G + C content of 68.3 mol%and 3142 annotated protein coding genes. At least two hypothetical proviruseswere detected in the genome. It lacked a CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) locus. Sequence similarity and phylogenetic treereconstructions placed it within the genus Halorubrum as a potential new species.VOLN27B exhibits a distinct difference in the frequency of codon usage againstits host strain Halorubrum sp. LN27.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is known to be a highly heterogeneous disease that isclinically subdivided into four primary molecular subtypes, each having distinct morphology and clinical implications. These subtypes are principally defined byhormone receptors and other proteins involved (or not involved) in BCdevelopment. BC therapeutic vaccines [including peptide-based vaccines,protein-based vaccines, nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA/RNA vaccines),bacterial/viral-based vaccines, and different immune cell-based vaccines] haveemerged as an appealing class of cancer immunotherapeutics when used alone orcombined with other immunotherapies. Employing the immune system to eliminate BC cells is a novel therapeutic modality. The benefit of active immunotherapies isthat they develop protection against neoplastic tissue and readjust the immunesystem to an anti-tumor monitoring state. Such immunovaccines have not yet shown effectiveness for BC treatment in clinical trials. In recent years, nanomedicineshave opened new windows to increase the effectiveness of vaccinations to treatBC. In this context, some nanoplatforms have been designed to efficiently delivermolecular, cellular, or subcellular vaccines to BC cells, increasing the efficacyand persistence of anti-tumor immunity while minimizing undesirable side effects.Immunostimulatory nano-adjuvants, liposomal-based vaccines, polymeric vaccines,virus-like particles, lipid/calcium/phosphate nanoparticles, chitosan-derivednanostructures, porous silicon microparticles, and selenium nanoparticles areamong the newly designed nanostructures that have been used to facilitate antigeninternalization and presentation by antigen-presenting cells, increase antigenstability, enhance vaccine antigenicity and remedial effectivity, promote antigenescape from the endosome, improve cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and producehumoral immune responses in BC cells. Here, we summarized the existing subtypesof BC and shed light on immunomodulatory and nano-therapeutic strategies for BCvaccination. Finally, we reviewed ongoing clinical trials on BC vaccination andhighlighted near-term opportunities for moving forward.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasma leakage is a major pathogenic manifestation of severe dengueand is a precursor of life-threatening complications associated with dengue.Accumulating evidence indicates the role of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) inmediating vascular permeability and plasma leakage following induction by thedengue virus. This study aims to investigate the utility of MMP-2, MMP-3, andMMP-9 in predicting the severity of dengue infection and further explore therelationship of these markers with the pathogenic factors associated with plasma leakage. METHODS: The dengue-positive subjects were classified into mild andsevere dengue groups based on the manifestation of warning signs. The samples in each group and healthy controls were quantified for basic laboratorycharacteristics. The levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and Macrophage migrationinhibitory factor (MIF) were estimated in all serum samples using a multiplexbead-based assay. RESULTS: MMP-2 and MMP-9 were markedly elevated in severedengue patients compared to mild dengue patients and healthy controls. Noalteration in the circulating levels of MMP-3 was observed between the studygroups. ROC curve analysis indicated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 exhibited goodpotential for predicting severe dengue. Notably, an increase in MMP-9 wasassociated with increased MIF and Hematocrit levels in severe dengue patients.CONCLUSION: MMP-2 and MMP-9 could serve as prognostic biomarkers for severedengue. These findings also identify the association of MMP-9 with markers ofplasma leakage, thereby encouraging further studies to explore the therapeuticpotential of targeting MMP-9 in managing plasma leakage in severe dengue.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine detection frequency of respiratoryviruses (equine influenza virus (EIV), equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), EHV-2,EHV-4, EHV-5, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), ERBV) and bacteria (Streptococcusequi ss. equi (S. equi), S. equi ss. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus)) in 162nasal secretions and 149 stall swabs from healthy sport horses attending a springshow in California. Nasal and stall swabs were collected at a single time pointand analyzed using qPCR. The detection frequency of respiratory pathogens innasal secretions was 38.9% for EHV-2, 36.4% for EHV-5, 19.7% for S.zooepidemicus, 1.2% for ERBV, 0.6% for S. equi and 0% for EIV, EHV-1, EHV-4 andERAV. The detection frequency of respiratory pathogens in stall swabs was 65.8%for S. zooepidemicus, 33.5% for EHV-2, 27.5% for EHV-5, 3.3% for EHV-1, 1.3% for EHV-4 and 0% for EIV, ERAV, ERBV and S. equi. Commensal viruses and bacteria werefrequently detected in nasal secretions and stall swabs from healthy sporthorses. This was in sharp contrast to the subclinical shedding ofwell-characterized respiratory pathogens. Of interest was the clustering of five EHV-1 qPCR-positive stalls from apparently healthy horses with no evidence ofclinical spread. The results highlight the role of subclinical shedders inintroducing respiratory pathogens to shows and their role in environmentalcontamination. The results also highlight the need to improve cleanliness anddisinfection of stalls utilized by performance horses during show events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the use of baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1-2inhibitor, for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.METHODS: This randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (RandomisedEvaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple possibletreatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible andconsenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard ofcare alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily bymouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primaryoutcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Ameta-analysis was done, which included the results from the RECOVERY trial andall previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitorin patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial is registered withISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Feb 2 and Dec 29, 2021, from 10 852 enrolled, 8156 patients were randomlyallocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib versus usual care alone. Atrandomisation, 95% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and 23% werereceiving tocilizumab (with planned use within the next 24 h recorded for afurther 9%). Overall, 514 (12%) of 4148 patients allocated to baricitinib versus 546 (14%) of 4008 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days(age-adjusted rate ratio 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.99; p=0.028). This 13% proportional reduction in mortality was somewhat smaller than that seen in a meta-analysis of eight previous trials of a JAK inhibitor (involving 3732 patients and 425deaths), in which allocation to a JAK inhibitor was associated with a 43%proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.57; 95% CI 0.45-0.72).Including the results from RECOVERY in an updated meta-analysis of all ninecompleted trials (involving 11 888 randomly assigned patients and 1485 deaths)allocation to baricitinib or another JAK inhibitor was associated with a 20%proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.72-0.89;p<0.0001). In RECOVERY, there was no significant excess in death or infection dueto non-COVID-19 causes and no significant excess of thrombosis, or other safetyoutcomes. INTERPRETATION: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, baricitinibsignificantly reduced the risk of death but the size of benefit was somewhatsmaller than that suggested by previous trials. The total randomised evidence to date suggests that JAK inhibitors (chiefly baricitinib) reduce mortality inpatients hospitalised for COVID-19 by about one-fifth.

AB  - Constitutive activation of plant immunity is detrimental to plant growth anddevelopment. Here, we uncover the role of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) infine-tuning the balance of plant immunity and growth. We find that a lncRNAtermed salicylic acid biogenesis controller 1 (SABC1) suppresses immunity andpromotes growth in healthy plants. SABC1 recruits the polycomb repressive complex2 to its neighboring gene NAC3, which encodes a NAC transcription factor, todecrease NAC3 transcription via H3K27me3. NAC3 activates the transcription ofisochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1), a key enzyme catalyzing salicylic acid (SA)biosynthesis. SABC1 thus represses SA production and plant immunity viadecreasing NAC3 and ICS1 transcriptions. Upon pathogen infection, SABC1 isdownregulated to derepress plant resistance to bacteria and viruses. Together,our findings reveal lncRNA SABC1 as a molecular switch in balancing plant defenseand growth by modulating SA biosynthesis.

AB  - Hepatitis E is caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV), one of the causes of acuteviral hepatitis. Domestic pigs are considered as the main reservoir of HEV-3. Therecently reported high prevalence of HEV in liver- and meat products on the Dutchmarket warranted a cross-sectional prevalence study on HEV infection among 5-6months old pigs slaughtered in the Netherlands (n = 250). For this, liver, caecumcontent and blood samples were analyzed for the presence of genomic HEV RNA byRT-PCR. In addition, a serological test was performed to detect HEV IgG.Background information was retrieved on the corresponding farms to evaluatepotential risk factors for HEV at pig slaughter age. HEV IgG was detected in serafrom 167 pigs (67.6 %). HEV RNA was detected in 64 (25.6 %) caecum contentsamples, in 40 (16.1 %) serum samples and in 25 (11.0 %) liver samples. Theaverage level of viral contamination in positive samples was log10 4.6 genomecopies (gc)/g (range 3.0-8.2) in caecum content, log10 3.3 gc/ml (range 2.4-5.9) in serum and log10 3.2 gc/0.1 g (range 1.7-6.2) in liver samples. Sequenceanalyses revealed HEV-3c only. Ten times an identical strain was detected in two or three samples obtained from the same pig. Each animal in this study howeverappeared to be infected with a unique strain. The presence of sows and gilts and welfare rating at the farm of origin had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on thedistribution over the four groups representing different stages of HEV infection based on IgG or RNA in caecum and/or serum. The observed proportion of testedpigs with viremia (16 %) was higher than in other reported studies and wasinterestingly often observed in combination with a high number of HEV genomecopies in liver and caecum content as detected by RT-qPCR. Data provided will be useful for risk assessment for food safety of pork products, will providebaseline data for future monitoring of HEV infections in pigs and new thoughtsfor mitigation strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Natalizumab (NTZ) is increasingly being used in Indian multiplesclerosis (MS) patients. There are no reports on its safety and efficacy,especially with respect to the occurrence of progressive multifocalleukoencephalopathy (PML). OBJECTIVES: To describe the patient characteristics,treatment outcomes, and adverse events, especially the occurrence of PML inNTZ-treated patients. METHODS: A multicentre ambispective study was conductedacross 18 centres, from Jan 2012 to Dec 2021. Patients at and above the age of 18years treated with NTZ were included. Descriptive and comparative statistics wereapplied to analyze data. RESULTS: During the study period of 9 years, 116patients were treated with NTZ. Mean age of the cohort was 35.6 +/- 9.7 years;83/116 (71.6%) were females. Relapse rate for the entire cohort in the yearbefore NTZ was 3.1 +/- 1.51 while one year after was 0.20+/-0.57 (p = 0.001; CI2.45 -3.35). EDSS of the entire cohort in the year before NTZ was 4.5 +/- 1.94and one year after was 3.8 +/- 2.7 (p = 0.013; CI 0.16-1.36). At last follow up(38.3 +/- 22.78 months) there were no cases of PML identified. CONCLUSIONS:Natalizumab is highly effective and safe in Indian MS patients, with no cases of PML identified at last follow up.

AB  - The EBV as the 'gluten of MS' hypothesis discussed by Drosu et al. in a recentEditorial envisages the existence of similar mechanisms leading to celiac diseaseand multiple sclerosis, such as induction of immunity against an ubiquitousexogenous antigen - gluten and EBV, respectively - and subsequent development of autoimmunity that is maintained by persistence of the initial trigger. While thishypothesis provides the rationale for treating MS with antivirals to lower EBVload, it can be misleading when trying to translate concepts of T cell-B cellinteraction and autoimmunity development in celiac disease to multiple sclerosis.Here, we propose that EBV might act as the driver of multiple sclerosis withoutinvolving autoimmunity.

AB  - Innate immune system composed of pathogen pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) isthe first barrier to recognize and defend viral invasion. Previouslythedouble-stranded RNA binding protein staufen1 (STAU1) was identified as animportant candidate in regulating RIG-I/MDA5 signaling axis, which is the majorcytosolic PRRs for initiating immune response to antagonize RNA viruses. However,the mechanism of STAU1 on RNA virus infection is still unclear. In the presentstudy, we demonstrated that STAU1 is a highly conservative dsRNA-binding protein in human and mammals. The porcine STAU1 (pSTAU1) could bind to the PEDV original dsRNA in cytoplasm. Furthermore, pSTAU1 is a binding partner that can positively increase the combination of MDA5 and dsRNA in cells, but slightly on RIG-I-dsRNA binding. Moreover, knockdown pSTAU1 led to inhibition of poly(I:C)-stimulated,VSV and RIG-I/MDA5-induced activation of porcine INF-beta promotor activation.Overexpression pSTAU1 could positively suppress the VSV proliferation in 3D4/21cells. In sum, our data identify pSTAU1 as a key component of RIG-I/MDA5 binding viral dsRNA required for innate antiviral immunity in swine. The novel findingsprovide a new insight into host sensing the RNA-viruses infection.

AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a ubiquitous and economically important swinealphaherpesvirus that causes devastating swine diseases worldwide. PRV-encodedDNA-dependent DNA polymerase, comprised of the catalytic subunit UL30 and theaccessory subunit UL42, is essential for viral replication. PRV UL30 and UL42 actas a heterodimer with UL30 harboring inherent DNA polymerase activity and UL42conferring processivity on the DNA polymerase holoenzyme. The formation of PRVUL30/UL42 heterodimer holoenzyme through protein-protein interactions isindispensable for viral replication. In work described here, we defined the keydomains that mediate PRV UL30/UL42 interaction, and found that the 41carboxy-terminal amino acids region of PRV UL30 is critical for its interactionwith UL42. Intriguingly, a synthetic peptide corresponding to these 41carboxy-terminal amino acid residues efficiently disrupted PRV UL30/UL42interaction through competitively binding to UL42. These findings suggest thatthe peptides from the PRV DNA polymerase UL30/UL42 subunit interface mayrepresent potential targets for designing a novel intervention strategy againstPRV infection. This work further strengthens the concept that the herpesvirus DNApolymerase catalytic subunits utilize their extreme carboxy-terminal domains as aconserved mechanism to associate with their cognate accessory subunits, providingus the opportunity of designing novel antiviral agents against herpesvirusinfection through disruption of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase subunitinteractions.

AB  - Natural Killer cells (NK) are crucial in host defense against viruses. There are many unanswered questions about the immune system in COVID-19, especially themechanisms that contribute to the development of mild or severe forms of thedisease. Although NK cells may have an essential role in the pathogenesis ofCOVID-19, the mechanisms involved in this process are not yet fully elucidated.Here, we demonstrate that CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells frequency in the volunteers who recovered from mild COVID-19 (Mild CoV) presented a significant increase comparedto the healthy control (HC) and individuals recovering from severe COVID-19(Severe CoV) groups. Furthermore, distinct IFN profiles in recovered COVID-19patients with mild or severe clinical forms of the disease were observed in thetotal NK cells (CD3(-)CD56(+)). In the first group, NK cells express increasedlevels of IFN-alpha compared to the severe CoV, while higher production ofIFN-gamma in severe CoV was found. Moreover, NK cells in mild CoV express morecytolytic granules depicted by granzyme B and perforin. Compared to HC, PBMCsfrom mild CoV presented higher Ki-67 and TIM-3 production after Pool CoV-2 andPool Spike CoV-2 peptides stimulus. In addition, non-stimulated PBMCs in the mildCoV group had higher NK TIM-3+ frequency than severe CoV. In the mild CoV group, Pool Spike CoV-2 and Pool CoV-2 peptides stimuli elicited higher granzyme B andperforin coexpression and IFN-alpha production by PBMCs. However, in severe CoV, Pool Spike CoV-2 reduced the coexpression of granzyme B, perforin, and CD107asuggesting a decrease in the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. Therefore, our studyshows that NK cells may have a crucial role in COVID-19 with the involvement ofIFN-alpha and cytotoxic properties that aid in developing qualified immuneresponses. Furthermore, the data suggest that higher amounts of IFN-gamma may be linked to the severity of this disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evidence to support Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-directed populationnasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) screening has been growing. Familial aggregationis a well-recognized phenomenon in endemic regions. This systematic reviewsummarizes the role of EBV-directed screening in individuals with a positivefamily history (FH+) of NPC. METHODS: We searched four electronic databases from their inception to October 2021. We included studies on individuals with FH+ ofNPC who had undergone EBV-directed investigations, with no restriction in thetesting methods or analytic techniques. The primary and secondary outcomes wereEBV positivity rates and NPC incidence rates, respectively. Meta-analyses wereperformed using the random-effect model. RESULTS: Ten cross-sectional studies (n = 7436) and three cohort studies (n = 4306) were included. The pooled relativerisk (RR) of EBV positivity between individuals with and without FH+ of NPC were 2.79 (95 % CI 1.37-5.68, p = 0.005) for viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgA, 3.09 (95 % CI 0.65-14.83, p = 0.16) for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA1) IgA, and 1.76(95 % CI 1.04-2.96, p = 0.03) for combined EBNA1/VCA IgA. In the three cohortstudies, the NPC incidence rates ranged from 90.2 to 266 per 100 000 person-yearswith high proportions of early-stage diseases. FH+ individuals who wereEBV-positive had a 2.5 to 30.7-fold risk of NPC development compared to theirEBV-negative counterparts. CONCLUSION: Family members of NPC patients hadsignificantly higher EBV positivity rates than the general population. FH+individuals who are EBV-positive had high risks of developing NPC. Familialscreening using EBV serology may facilitate early NPC detection in endemic areas.

AB  - As influenza-A viruses (IAV) replicate in the host cell nucleus, intranuclearpathways are usurped for viral gene expression. The eight genomic viralribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) segments of IAV are transcribed and two generate viralmRNAs (M and NS) that undergo alternative splicing followed by export from thenucleus. The focus of this review is on viral RNA splicing and nuclear export.Recent mechanistic advances on M and NS splicing show differential regulation by RNA-binding proteins as well as distinct intranuclear localization. After areview of IAV splicing, we will discuss the nuclear export of viral mRNAs, which occur by interacting with specific constituents of the host mRNA export machinerythat translocate viral mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex for translation in the cytoplasm.

TI  - Optogenetic approaches to therapy for inherited retinal degenerations.
LID - 10.1113/JP282076 [doi]
AB  - Inherited retinal degenerations such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affectapproximately 1 in 4000 people, and are the leading cause of blindness in workingage adults in several countries. In these typically monogenic conditions, thereis progressive degeneration of photoreceptors, however inner retinal neurons suchas bipolar cells and ganglion cells remain largely structurally intact, even inend-stage disease. Therapeutic approaches aiming to stimulate these residualcells, independent of the underlying genetic cause, could potentially restorevisual function in patients with advanced vision loss, and benefit many morepatients than therapies directed at the specific gene implicated in eachdisorder. One approach investigated for this purpose is that of optogenetics, amethod of neuromodulation that utilises light to activate neurons engineered toectopically express a light-sensitive protein. Using gene therapy viaadeno-associated viral vectors (AAV), a range of photosensitive proteins havebeen expressed in remaining retinal cells in advanced retinal degeneration within vivo studies demonstrating restoration of visual function. Developing aneffective optogenetic strategy requires consideration of multiple factorsincluding the light-sensitive protein that is used, the vector and method forgene delivery and the target cell for expression, as these in turn may affect thequality of vision that can be restored. Currently, at least four clinical trials are ongoing to investigate optogenetic therapies in patients, with the ultimateaim of reversing visual loss in end-stage disease. Abstract figure legend.Optogenetic approaches for vision restoration in end-stage retinal degenerationIn inherited retinal degenerations, there is progressive loss of photoreceptors(rods and cones) but inner retinal structures remain largely intact. Optogenetic strategies aim to induce light sensitivity in remaining retinal cells using gene therapy, via ectopic expression of an opsin gene. The most widely investigatedapproach uses retinal transduction via an adeno-associated virus injected either into the subretinal space or via intravitreal injection, with the aim of visionrestoration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Elderly population is the most vulnerable group of the COVID-19pandemic, since they often live with chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: The goal of ourresearch is to analyze the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on theHungarian population over 60 years of age. METHOD: We collected data using theauthentic Hungarian translation of the "World-Wide FINGERS SARS-CoV-2 Survey"between 1st of February and 1st of June 2021. RESULTS: Our study included 431people with a low rate of COVID infection (6%). The most marked changes were the increase in the use of digital services in 71%, increased feeling of lonelinessin 46%, decrease in subjective sleep quality in 47%, and reduced contact withfriends and relatives in 80% of the respondents. Eight-six percent ofparticipants had at least one chronic illness and 23% missed an illness-relatedmedical visit during the pandemic. In 45%, the subjective quality of lifedeteriorated and 25% reported impairment of memory functions. DISCUSSION:Participants became socially isolated during the pandemic having a significantnegative impact on their way of life. The changes in physical and mental healthare likely to be reflected in an increased incidence and accelerated progression of age-related diseases in the elderly. CONCLUSION: In order to reduce the directand indirect harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramountimportance to know how the pandemic and the following restrictions affect thebehavior and lifestyle of the elderly as well as the care of patients living withchronic diseases.

AB  - Background: A potential explanation for the fact that the high rate of infection of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa did not translate into high rates of severe illnessand death may be the presence of cross-reactive immunity induced by common coldcoronaviruses (CCoV). Methods: We used SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools and whole virusantigen to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected pre-2020 fromSouth African women. Dual-colour FluoroSpot assay was used to measure interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin 2 (IL2) production. Results: Among the 97 study participants, IFNgamma responses were observed in 29.9% of the women and IL2among 39.2%. Overall, 51.6% of women demonstrated response to at least onestimulant. Conclusion: We demonstrate the presence of cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, which might have been induced by past exposure to CCoV.

AB  - Background: This study was done to describe the pattern of personal protectiveequipment (PPE) use, associated factors, and adverse events among obstetriciansand obstetric nurses in obstetrics & gynecology departments. Methods: A crosssectional study was conducted in Obstetrics & Gynecology departments in threehospitals (physician & nurses n=252) using an online Google form includingdemographic and occupational health data, type of available personal protectiveequipment during usual care, CS and emergency labor, infection control measuresand hazards of full PPE use. Results Full PPE use was 37.7% during CS and 34.9%during emergency labor. The significant predictors of wearing full PPE during CS were daily work hours > 8 hours and receiving formal training about PPE use.During CS & emergency labor most of HCws used sterile gloves and sterile fluidresistant gowns and surgical mask.to less extent used face shields or tightfitting googles and one tenth (11.8%) only used N95. The most common healtheffects of full PPE use was sense of heat (79.5%) . Conclusion: During theCOVID-19 pandemic more vigorous respiratory (N95 mask) and eye protection isrequired during aerosol-generating procedures. Formal training is an evidentpredictor for full PPE use.

TI  - Feeding behaviour and mortality of Philaenus spumarius exposed to insecticidesand their impact on Xylella fastidiosa transmission.
LID - 10.1002/ps.7105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insecticides are essential, although controversial tools in modernpest management. However, insecticides can slow the spread of key vector-borneplant pathogens but often lead to inconsistent results given that insecticide useis generally focused on acute toxicity under no-choice conditions. Here, weanalysed the lethal (survival) and sub-lethal (feeding behaviour) effects of six commercial products (acetamiprid, deltamethrin, spinosad, sulfoxaflor, pyrethrin,and kaolin) on Philaenus spumarius, vector of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa.Furthermore, we assessed the impact of insecticides displaying different degrees of acute toxicity against spittlebugs (highest to lowest: acetamiprid, pyrethrin and kaolin) on the transmission of X. fastidiosa by P. spumarius under bothfree-choice and no-choice conditions. RESULTS: Deltamethrin, acetamiprid and to alimited extent pyrethrin significantly altered the feeding behaviour of P.spumarius. However, deltamethrin and acetamiprid were highly toxic against P.spumarius, but the mortality induced by exposure to pyrethrin was limitedoverall. In contrast, spinosad, sulfoxaflor and kaolin did not significantlyimpact P. spumarius feeding behaviour or survival. Under no-choice conditions,both pyrethrin and acetamiprid reduced the X. fastidiosa inoculation ratecompared to kaolin and the control. On the other hand, pyrethrin reducedtransmission, but acetamiprid failed to significantly affect bacterialinoculation under free-choice conditions. CONCLUSION: Pyrethrin was the onlycompound able to reduce X. fastidiosa transmission under both free-choice andno-choice conditions. Xylella fastidiosa management strategy exclusively based onthe evaluation of insecticide acute toxicity under no-choice conditions couldmost likely fail to prevent, or slow down, bacterial spread.

AB  - The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as an attractivedrug target because of its central role in viral replication. Our previouspreliminary molecular docking studies showed that theaflavin 3-gallate (a naturalbioactive molecule derived from theaflavin and found in high abundance in blacktea) exhibited better docking scores than repurposed drugs (Atazanavir,Darunavir, Lopinavir). In this study, conventional and steered MD-simulationsanalyses revealed stronger interactions of theaflavin 3-gallate with the activesite residues of M(pro) than theaflavin and a standard molecule GC373 (a knowninhibitor of M(pro) and novel broad-spectrum anti-viral agent). Theaflavin3-gallate inhibited M(pro) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of 18.48 +/- 1.29 muM. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (Indian/a3i clade/2020 isolate) with 200 muM oftheaflavin 3-gallate in vitro using Vero cells and quantifying viral transcripts demonstrated reduction of viral count by 75% (viral particles reduced fromLog10(6.7) to Log10(6.1)). Overall, our findings suggest that theaflavin3-gallate effectively targets the M(pro) thus limiting the replication of theSARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.

AB  - The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) hasbeen ongoing for over two years, and treatment for COVID-19, other thanmonoclonal antibodies, is urgently required. Accordingly, we have investigatedthe inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 protein targets by high-throughput virtual screeningusing a marine natural products database. Considering the calculated molecularproperties and availability of the compounds, (+)-usnic acid was selected as asuitable hit. In the in vitro antiviral assay of (+)-usnic acid by theimmunofluorescence method, IC50 was 7.99 muM, which is similar to that ofremdesivir used as a positive control. The generalized Born and surface areacontinuum solvation (MM/GBSA) method was performed to find the potent target of(+)-usnic acid, and the Mpro protein showed the most prominent value, -52.05kcal/mol, among other SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. Thereafter, RMSD andprotein-ligand interactions were profiled using molecular dynamics (MD)simulations. Sodium usnate (NaU) improved in vitro assay results with an IC50 of 5.33 muM and a selectivity index (SI) of 9.38. Additionally, when (+)-usnic acid was assayed against SARS-CoV-2 variants, it showed enhanced efficacy toward beta variants with an IC50 of 2.92 muM and SI of 11.1. We report the in vitroanti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of (+)-usnic acid in this study and propose that it has the potential to be developed as a COVID-19 treatment if its in vivo efficacy hasbeen confirmed.

AB  - Studies are needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of mRNA SARS-CoV-2vaccination during pregnancy, and the levels of protection provided to theirnewborns through placental transfer of antibodies. Here, we evaluate thetransplacental transfer of mRNA vaccine products and functional anti-SARS-CoV-2antibodies during pregnancy and early infancy in a cohort of 20 individualsvaccinated during late pregnancy. We find no evidence of mRNA vaccine products inmaternal blood, placenta tissue, or cord blood at delivery. However, we findtime-dependent efficient transfer of IgG and neutralizing antibodies to theneonate that persists during early infancy. Additionally, using phageimmunoprecipitation sequencing, we find a vaccine-specific signature ofSARS-CoV-2 Spike protein epitope binding that is transplacentally transferredduring pregnancy. Timing of vaccination during pregnancy is critical to ensuretransplacental transfer of protective antibodies during early infancy.

AB  - The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium(ISARIC) COVID-19 dataset is one of the largest international databases ofprospectively collected clinical data on people hospitalized with COVID-19. This dataset was compiled during the COVID-19 pandemic by a network of hospitals that collect data using the ISARIC-World Health Organization Clinical CharacterizationProtocol and data tools. The database includes data from more than 705,000patients, collected in more than 60 countries and 1,500 centres worldwide.Patient data are available from acute hospital admissions with COVID-19 andoutpatient follow-ups. The data include signs and symptoms, pre-existingcomorbidities, vital signs, chronic and acute treatments, complications, dates ofhospitalization and discharge, mortality, viral strains, vaccination status, and other data. Here, we present the dataset characteristics, explain itsarchitecture and how to gain access, and provide tools to facilitate its use.

TI  - Refining the risk of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy in people living with HTLV-1:identification of a HAM-like phenotype in a proportion of asymptomatic carriers.
LID - 10.1007/s13365-022-01088-x [doi]
AB  - Up to 3.8% of human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1)-infected asymptomaticcarriers (AC) eventually develop HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM). HAM occursin patients with high (> 1%) HTLV proviral load (PVL). However, this cut-offincludes more than 50% of ACs and therefore the risk needs to be refined. As HAM is additionally characterised by an inflammatory response to HTLV-1, markers of Tcell activation (TCA), beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) and neuronal damage wereaccessed for the identification of ACs at high risk of HAM. Retrospectiveanalysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal routine clinical data examiningdifferences in TCA (CD4/CD25, CD4/HLA-DR, CD8/CD25 & CD8/HLA-DR), beta2M andneurofilament light (NfL) in plasma in ACs with high or low PVL and patients withHAM. Comparison between 74 low PVL ACs, 84 high PVL ACs and 58 patients with HAM revealed a significant, stepwise, increase in TCA and beta2M. Construction ofreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for each of these blood testsgenerated a profile that correctly identifies 88% of patients with HAM along with6% of ACs. The 10 ACs with this 'HAM-like' profile had increased levels of NfL inplasma and two developed myelopathy during follow-up, compared to none of the 148without this viral-immune-phenotype. A viral-immuno-phenotype resembling thatseen in patients with HAM identifies asymptomatic carriers who are at increasedrisk of developing HAM and have markers of subclinical neuronal damage.

PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/s12985-022-01807-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The H5 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has caused huge economiclosses to the poultry industry and is a threat to human health. A rapid andsimple test is needed to confirm infection in suspected cases during diseaseoutbreaks. METHODS: In this study, we developed a reverse transcriptionrecombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) assay for the detection of H5 subtypeAIV. Assays were performed at a single temperature (39 degrees C), and theresults were obtained within 20 min. RESULTS: The assay showed no cross-detectionwith Newcastle disease virus or infectious bronchitis virus. The analyticalsensitivity was 10(3) RNA copies/muL at a 95% confidence interval according toprobit regression analysis, with 100% specificity. Compared with publishedreverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays,the kappa value of the RT-RAA assay in 420 avian clinical samples was 0.983 (p < 0.001). The sensitivity for avian clinical sample detection was 97.26% (95% CI,89.56-99.52%), and the specificity was 100% (95% CI, 98.64-100%). CONCLUSIONS:These results indicated that our RT-RAA assay may be a valuable tool fordetecting H5 subtype AIV.

TI  - The microbiological landscape and epidemiology of ocular infections in amulti-tier ophthalmology network in India: an electronic medical record drivenanalytics report.
LID - 10.1038/s41433-022-02191-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology and landscape of ocular infections inpatients undergoing microbiological investigations across a multi-tierophthalmology network in India. METHODS: This cross-sectional hospital-basedstudy included 15,822 patients in whom microbiology samples were analysed betweenSeptember 2013 and December 2021. Ocular tissue of patients in whom amicrobiology sample was processed in at least one eye were included. The datawere collected using an indigenously developed electronic medical record system. RESULTS: Among the 15,822 patients, bacteria (51.06%) was the most commonaetiology followed by fungus (38.27%). The majority of the patients were male(68.10%) and adults (90.01%). The most common age group was during the sixthdecade of life with 2,914 (18.42%) patients. The patients were more commonly fromthe lower socio-economic status (51.61%) and from the rural geography (46.82%).Majority of the specimens sent for microbiological analysis were cornealscrapings (68.61%) followed by vitreous (8.77%). The most common bacteriaisolated was Staphylococcus aureus (14.45%) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa(12.53%) and among the fungus were Fusarium (30.53%) and Aspergillus species(29.86%). Acanthamoeba (1.26%) and Microsporidia (0.38%) accounted for a minorityof the infections in the samples. Fungus (53.10%; p </= 0.00001) and virus(51.08%; p = 0.000673) aetiology was found to be significantly higher in patientspresenting from the rural geography. CONCLUSION: The most common aetiology ofinfection in ocular disease is bacterial but fungal infections also accounted fora significant proportion. The majority of the patients with ocular infectionspresented from the rural geography and from lower socio-economic status.

AB  - The development of a maternal HIV vaccine to synergize with currentantiretroviral drug prophylaxis can overcome implementation challenges andfurther reduce mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. Both theepitope-specificity and autologous neutralization capacity of maternal HIVenvelope (Env)-specific antibodies have been implicated in decreased risk of MTCTof HIV. Our goal was to determine if heterologous HIV Env immunization ofSHIV.C.CH505-infected, ART-suppressed female rhesus macaques (RMs) could boostautologous Env-specific antibodies. SHIV.C.CH505-infected female RMs (n = 12),began a daily ART regimen at 12 weeks post-infection (wpi), which was continuedfor 12 weeks. Starting 2 weeks after ART initiation, RMs received 3 monthlyimmunizations with HIV b.63521/1086.C gp120 or placebo (n = 6/group) vaccine withadjuvant STR8S-C. Compared to the placebo-immunized animals, Env-vaccinated,SHIV-infected RMs exhibited enhanced IgG binding, avidity, and ADCC responsesagainst the vaccine immunogens and the autologous SHIV.C.CH505 Env. Notably, the Env-specific memory B cells elicited by heterologous vaccination were dominatedby cells that recognized the SHIV.C.CH505 Env, the antigen of primary exposure.Thus, vaccination of SHIV-infected, ART-suppressed RMs with heterologous HIV Envscan augment multiple components of the antibody response against the Env antigen of primary exposure, suggesting antigenic seniority. Our results suggest that auniversal maternal HIV vaccination regimen can be developed to leverage antigenicseniority in targeting the maternal autologous virus pool.

PG  - 664
LID - 10.1038/s41419-022-05107-x [doi]
AB  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy ubiquitouslyassociated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV generates various viral microRNAs(miRNAs) by processing the BHRF1 and BamHI A rightward (BART) transcripts. These BART miRNAs are abundantly expressed in NPC, but their functions and molecularmechanisms remain largely unknown. Our study found that the EBV-encoded microRNA BART-22 was significantly upregulated in NPC tissues and positively correlatedwith tumor progression. Furthermore, we found that EBV-miR-BART-22 was asignificant predictor of poor prognosis in NPC. A reliable nomogram model topredict the preoperative overall survival (OS) of NPC patients was established.The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value for 5-yearsurvival was 0.91. Elevated levels of EBV-miR-BART-22 significantly promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis of NPC cells in vivo andin vitro. We found that EBV-miR-BART-22 directly targets the 3'-UTR of MOSPD2mRNA to promote the EMT and metastasis of NPC cells by activating theWnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings provide a potential prognosticbiomarker and new insight into the molecular mechanisms of NPC metastasis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent research has documented the potential associations existingbetween the use of social media (SM) and the occurrence/development and treatmentof Eating Disorders (ED). However, the literature directly addressing the use of SM TikTok among children and adolescents with ED is still scarce. METHODS: InJanuary-February 2021, during the second Italian national lockdown due to theSARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an anonymous paper survey was conducted in an Italianthird-level center for ED in childhood and adolescence. Demographics, frequencyof use of TikTok, frequently viewed topics and hashtags, experiencedbody-shaming, as well as the use of TikTok (active search, use of proposedcontents) and perceived influences of this SM on eating attitudes and self-esteemwere assessed. Groups of patients with different perceived SM-induced effectswere compared to determine the frequency of their interaction with 3 specificcontents (diet, Pro-Anorexia Nervosa (pro-Ana) and pro-ED recovery). RESULTS:Seventy-eight patients (93.6% females, mean age 14.5 +/- 2.1 years) were enrolledin the study. For 62.8%, TikTok represented the main SM, used for 1.4 +/- 1.0h/day, with diet (21.8%) as the most frequently used topic category. Pro-Ana and pro-ED recovery contents ("#foryou" and "#edrecovery" as the most frequent,respectively) were both actively searched by patients and proposed by the SM in asignificant number of cases. For 59.0%, using TikTok reduced self-esteem, while26.9% reported TikTok-related significant changes in their daily lives, and 3.8% reported experiences of body-shaming. Patients describing a negative effect ofTikTok on their self-esteem more frequently searched and browsed "diet" (p =0.007) and pro-ED recovery (p = 0.007) contents. Positive qualitative feedback onthe SM was also reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the use of the SMTikTok among children and adolescents with ED. Individuals with a perceivednegative effect of this SM on their self-esteem may show greater interaction withspecific content. Further studies are needed to investigate thepsychopathological factors influencing the relationship between ED and the use ofSM.

PG  - 4431
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32159-6 [doi]
AB  - Acquired resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancers is partially mediated bythe acquisition of mutations located in the cetuximab epitope in the epidermalgrowth factor receptor (EGFR) ectodomain and hinders the clinical application of cetuximab. We develop a structure-guided and phage-assisted evolution approachfor cetuximab evolution to reverse EGFR(S492R)- or EGFR(G465R)-driven resistance without altering the binding epitope or undermining antibody efficacy. Twoevolved cetuximab variants, Ctx-VY and Ctx-Y104D, exhibit a restored bindingability with EGFR(S492R), which harbors the most common resistance substitution, S492R. Ctx-W52D exhibits restored binding with EGFR harboring another commoncetuximab resistance substitution, G465R (EGFR(G465R)). All the evolved cetuximabvariants effectively inhibit EGFR activation and downstream signaling and induce the internalization and degradation of EGFR(S492R) and EGFR(G465R) as well asEGFR(WT). The evolved cetuximab variants (Ctx-VY, Ctx-Y104D and Ctx-W52D) withone or two amino acid substitutions in the complementarity-determining regioninherit the optimized physical and chemical properties of cetuximab to a greatextent, thus ensuring their druggability. Our data collectively show thatstructure-guided and phage-assisted evolution is an efficient and generalapproach for reversing receptor mutation-mediated resistance to therapeuticantibody drugs.

TI  - The COVID-related mental health load of neonatal healthcare professionals: amulticenter study in Italy.
PG  - 136
LID - 10.1186/s13052-022-01305-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected healthcareprofessionals' lives. We investigated the potential mental health risk faced byhealthcare professionals working in neonatal units in a multicentrecross-sectional observational study. METHODS: We included all healthcarepersonnel of seven level-3 and six level-2 neonatal units in Tuscany, Italy. Wemeasured the level of physical exposure to COVID-19 risk, self-reportedpandemic-related stress, and mental health load outcomes (anxiety, depression,burnout, psychosomatic symptoms, and post-traumatic symptoms) using validated,self-administered, online questionnaires during the second pandemic wave in Italy(October 2020 to March 2021). RESULTS: We analyzed 314 complete answers. Scoresabove the clinical cutoff were reported by 91% of participants for symptoms ofanxiety, 29% for post-traumatic symptoms, 13% for burnout, and 3% for symptoms ofdepression. Moreover, 50% of the participants reported at least one psychosomaticsymptom. Pandemic-related stress was significantly associated with all themeasured mental health load outcomes, with an Odds Ratio of 3.31 (95% confidence interval: 1.87, 5.88) for clinically relevant anxiety, 2.46 (1.73, 3.49) forpost-traumatic symptoms, 1.80 (1.17, 2.79) for emotional exhaustion, and 2.75(1.05, 7.19) for depression. Female health care professionals displayed a greaterrisk of anxiety, and male health care professionals and nurses, of depressivesymptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low direct clinical impact of COVID-19 innewborns, neonatal professionals, due to both living in a situation ofuncertainty and personal exposure to contacts with parents and other relatives ofthe newborns, and having to carry out activities once routine and now fraughtwith uncertainty, displayed clear signs of mental health load outcomes. They mustbe considered a specific population at risk for psychological consequences duringthe pandemic.

TI  - Experience with open schools and preschools in periods of high communitytransmission of COVID-19 in Norway during the academic year of 2020/2021.
PG  - 1454

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schools and preschools have largely remained open in Norwaythroughout the pandemic, with flexible mitigation measures in place. Thiscontrasts with many other high-income countries that closed schools for longperiods of time. Here we describe cases and outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools and preschools during the academic year 2020/2021, to evaluate the strategy ofkeeping these open with infection prevention control measures in place. METHODS: In this descriptive study, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health initiatedsystematic surveillance for COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in schools andpreschools in October 2020. Data was compiled from the national outbreak alertsystem VESUV, municipality websites, and media scanning combined with thenational emergency preparedness register Beredt C-19. An outbreak was defined as >/= 2 cases among pupils or staff within 14 days at the same educational setting.Settings were categorized as preschool (1-5-years), primary school (6-12-years), lower secondary school (13-15-years) and upper secondary school (16-18- years).We reported the incidence rate among preschool and school-aged pupils and gave a descriptive overview of outbreaks and included cases per educational setting.RESULTS: During the whole academic year, a total of 1203 outbreaks in preschools and school settings were identified, out of a total of 8311 preschools andschools nationwide. The incidence of COVID-19 in preschool- and school-agedchildren and the rates of outbreaks in these settings largely followed thecommunity trend. Most of the outbreaks occurred in primary schools (40%) andpreschools (25%). Outbreaks across all settings were mostly small (median 3cases, range 2 to 72), however, 40 outbreaks (3% of total) included 20 or morecases. The larger outbreaks were predominantly seen in primary schools (43%).CONCLUSIONS: We observed few large outbreaks in open schools and preschools inNorway during the academic year of 2020/2021, also when the Alpha variant waspredominant. This illustrates that it is possible to keep schools and preschools open even during periods of high community transmission of COVID-19. Adherence totargeted IPC measures adaptable to the local situation has been essential to keepeducational settings open, and thus reduce the total burden on children andadolescents.

TI  - Iron oxide and iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles impair SARS-CoV-2 infection ofcultured cells.
PG  - 352
LID - 10.1186/s12951-022-01542-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses usually cause mild respiratory disease in humans but asseen recently, some human coronaviruses can cause more severe diseases, such asthe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the globalspread of which has resulted in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. RESULTS: Inthis study we analyzed the potential of using iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)coated with biocompatible molecules like dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APS) or carboxydextran (FeraSpin R), as well asiron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles (IOHNPs) coated with sucrose (Venofer((R))), oriron salts (ferric ammonium citrate -FAC), to treat and/or prevent SARS-CoV-2infection. At non-cytotoxic doses, IONPs and IOHNPs impaired virus replicationand transcription, and the production of infectious viruses in vitro, either whenthe cells were treated prior to or after infection, although with differentefficiencies. Moreover, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects theexpression of genes involved in cellular iron metabolism. Furthermore, thetreatment of cells with IONPs and IOHNPs affects oxidative stress and ironmetabolism to different extents, likely influencing virus replication andproduction. Interestingly, some of the nanoparticles used in this work havealready been approved for their use in humans as anti-anemic treatments, such as the IOHNP Venofer((R)), and as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging in small animals like mice, such as the FeraSpin R IONP. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, ourresults suggest that IONPs and IOHNPs may be repurposed to be used asprophylactic or therapeutic treatments in order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created healthchallenges in all parts of the world. Understanding the entry mechanism of thisvirus into host cells is essential for effective treatment of COVID-19 disease.This virus can bind to various cell surface molecules or receptors, such asangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to gain cell entry. Respiratory failureand pulmonary edema are the most important causes of mortality from COVID-19infections. Cytokines, especially proinflammatory cytokines, are the mainmediators of these complications. For normal respiratory function, a healthyair-blood barrier and sufficient blood flow to the lungs are required. In thisreview, we first discuss airway epithelial cells, airway stem cells, and theexpression of COVID-19 receptors in the airway epithelium. Then, we discuss thesuggested molecular mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction and blood vessel damagein COVID-19. Coagulopathy can be caused by platelet activation leading to clots, which restrict blood flow to the lungs and lead to respiratory failure. Finally, we present an overview of the effects of immune and non-immune cells andcytokines in COVID-19-related respiratory failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive complaints are common in patients recovering fromCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet their etiology is often unclear. Weassess factors that contribute to cognitive impairment in ambulatory versushospitalized patients during the sub-acute stage of recovery. METHODS: In thiscross-sectional study, participants were prospectively recruited from ahospital-wide registry. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infectionusing a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay. Patients</= 18 years-of-age and those with a pre-existing major neurocognitive disorderwere excluded. Participants completed an extensive neuropsychologicalquestionnaire and a computerized cognitive screen via remote telemedicineplatform. Rates of subjective and objective neuropsychological impairment werecompared between the ambulatory and hospitalized groups. Factors associated with impairment were explored separately within each group. RESULTS: A total of 102patients (76 ambulatory, 26 hospitalized) completed the symptom inventory andneurocognitive tests 24 +/- 22 days following laboratory confirmation ofSARS-CoV-2 infection. Hospitalized and ambulatory patients self-reported highrates of cognitive impairment (27-40%), without differences between the groups.However, hospitalized patients showed higher rates of objective impairment invisual memory (30% vs. 4%; p = 0.001) and psychomotor speed (41% vs. 15%; p =0.008). Objective cognitive test performance was associated with anxiety,depression, fatigue, and pain in the ambulatory but not the hospitalized group.CONCLUSIONS: Focal cognitive deficits are more common in hospitalized thanambulatory patients. Cognitive performance is associated with neuropsychiatricsymptoms in ambulatory but not hospitalized patients. Objective neurocognitivemeasures can provide essential information to inform neurologic triage and shouldbe included as endpoints in clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed the influence of social, economic, andpsychological factors on South African's responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic.Although the South African government responded quickly to manage the pandemic,the strict lockdown placed a significant burden on the population. Understanding the converging influence of social, economic, and psychological factors on thepopulation's responsiveness is important for improving people's cooperation incontrolling COVID-19 and for supporting individuals and communities during theongoing and future pandemics. METHODS: Using data collected from a nationaltelephonic survey (December 2020 to March 2021), we assessed whether selectedsocial, economic and psychological factors were related to: 1) adoption ofCOVID-19 behavioural measures (hand hygiene, wearing of face masks, and physical distancing), and 2) adherence to government restrictions on movement. RESULTS:South Africans were highly responsive to the pandemic with respondents generally reporting that they very often engaged in the protective behaviours and often to very often adhered to government restriction on movement. However, those from thewhite population group; with a higher education; living in uncrowded households; who perceived less vulnerability to contracting COVID-19; supported the measures;trusted the scientists; thought the measures by government were implementedfairly and fairly enforced by the police; felt more anxious, sad, hopeless,isolated, angry or had trouble sleeping; inclined to engage in coping behaviour, were more likely to adopt COVID-19 protective behaviours. Furthermore, females,those with a lower education, those less likely to have experienced poverty sincethe beginning of lockdown; who perceived greater vulnerability to COVID-19,trusted government, and were more supportive of the behavioural measures weremore likely to adhere to the restrictions of movement. CONCLUSIONS: Strengtheningthe South African population's responsiveness to the pandemic requires supportingthose living in poor socioeconomic circumstances, promoting trust in thescientific evidence, and ensuring that the measures by government are perceivedto be fairly implemented and fairly enforced by the police. Due to the impact on livelihoods, restrictions of movement should only be considered if necessary, andthis will require trust and confidence in government and strategies to supportthose experiencing financial hardship.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first appeared in December 2019,and spread rapidly around the world. COVID-19 is a pneumonia caused by novelcoronavirus infection in 2019. COVID-19 is highly infectious and transmissible.By 7 May 2021, the total number of cumulative number of deaths is 3,259,033. Inorder to diagnose the infected person in time to prevent the spread of the virus,the diagnosis method for COVID-19 is extremely important. To solve the aboveproblems, this paper introduces a Multi-Level Enhanced Sensation module (MLES),and proposes a new convolutional neural network model, MLES-Net, based on thismodule. METHODS: Attention has the ability to automatically focus on the keypoints in various information, and Attention can realize parallelism, which canreplace some recurrent neural networks to a certain extent and improve theefficiency of the model. We used the correlation between global and localfeatures to generate the attention mask. First, the feature map was divided into multiple groups, and the initial attention mask was obtained by the dot productof each feature group and the feature after the global pooling. Then theattention masks were normalized. At the same time, there were two scaling andtranslating parameters in each group so that the normalize operation could berestored. Then, the final attention mask was obtained through the sigmoidfunction, and the feature of each location in the original feature group wasscaled. Meanwhile, we use different classifiers on the network models withdifferent network layers. RESULTS: The network uses three classifiers, FC module (fully connected layer), GAP module (global average pooling layer) and GAPFCmodule (global average pooling layer and fully connected layer), to improverecognition efficiency. GAPFC as a classifier can obtain the best comprehensiveeffect by comparing the number of parameters, the amount of calculation and thedetection accuracy. The experimental results show that the MLES-Net56-GAPFCachieves the best overall accuracy rate (95.27%) and the best recognition ratefor COVID-19 category (100%). CONCLUSIONS: MLES-Net56-GAPFC has goodclassification ability for the characteristics of high similarity betweencategories of COVID-19 X-Ray images and low intra-category variability.Considering the factors such as accuracy rate, number of network model parametersand calculation amount, we believe that the MLES-Net56-GAPFC network model hasbetter practicability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regional labour markets and their properties are named as potentialreasons for regional variations in levels of SARS-CoV-2 infections rates, butempirical evidence is missing. METHODS: Using nationwide data on notifiedlaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we calculated weekly age-standardisedincidence rates (ASIRs) for working-age populations at the regional level ofGermany's 400 districts. Data covered nearly 2 years (March 2020 till December2021), including four main waves of the pandemic. For each of the pandemic waves,we investigated regional differences in weekly ASIRs according to three regional labour market indicators: (1) employment rate, (2) employment by sector, and (3) capacity to work from home. We use spatial panel regression analysis, whichincorporates geospatial information and accounts for regional clustering ofinfections. RESULTS: For all four pandemic waves under study, we found thatregions with higher proportions of people in employment had higher ASIRs and asteeper increase of infections during the waves. Further, the composition of the workforce mattered: rates were higher in regions with larger secondary sectors orif opportunities of working from home were comparatively low. Associationsremained consistent after adjusting for potential confounders, including a proxy measure of regional vaccination progress. CONCLUSIONS: If further validated bystudies using individual-level data, our study calls for increased interventionefforts to improve protective measures at the workplace, particularly amongworkers of the secondary sector with no opportunities to work from home. It also points to the necessity of strengthening work and employment as essentialcomponents of pandemic preparedness plans.

TI  - Within-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review andmeta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14673 [doi]
AB  - Within-host model specified by viral dynamic parameters is a mainstream tool tounderstand SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle in infected patients. The parameteruncertainty further affects the output of the model, such as the efficacy ofpotential antiviral drugs. However, gathering empirical data on these parameters is challenging. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review of viral dynamicparameters used in within-host models by calibrating the model to the viral load data measured from upper respiratory specimens. We searched the PubMed, Embaseand Web of Science databases (between December 1, 2019 and February 10, 2022) forwithin-host modelling studies. We identified seven independent within-host modelsfrom the above nine studies, including Type I interferon, innate response,humoral immune response, or cell-mediated immune response. From these models, we extracted and analyse seven widely used viral dynamic parameters including theviral load at the point of infection or symptom onset, the rate of viralparticles infecting susceptible cells, the rate of infected cells releasingvirus, the rate of virus particles cleared, the rate of infected cells cleared,and the rate of cells in the eclipse phase can become productively infected. Weidentified seven independent within-host models from nine eligible studies. Theviral load at symptom onset is 4.78 (95% CI:2.93, 6.62) log(copies/mL), and theviral load at the point of infection is -1.00 (95% CI:-1.94, -0.05)log(copies/mL). The rate of viral particles infecting susceptible cells and therate of infected cells cleared have the pooled estimates as -6.96 (95% CI:-7.66, -6.25) log([copies/mL](-1) day(-1) ) and 0.92 (95% CI:-0.09, 1.93) day(-1) ,respectively. We found that the rate of infected cells cleared was associatedwith the reported model in the meta-analysis by including the model type as acategorical variable (p<0.01). Joint viral dynamic parameters estimates whenparameterizing within-host models have been published for SARS-CoV-2. Thereviewed viral dynamic parameters can be used in the same within-host model tounderstand SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle in infected patients and assess theimpact of pharmaceutical interventions.

LID - 10.1063/5.0099450 [doi]
AB  - We study the dynamic evolution of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant via afractional susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model. Preliminary datasuggest that the symptoms of Omicron infection are not prominent and thetransmission is, therefore, more concealed, which causes a relatively slowincrease in the detected cases of the newly infected at the beginning of thepandemic. To characterize the specific dynamics, the Caputo-Hadamard fractionalderivative is adopted to refine the classical SEIR model. Based on the reporteddata, we infer the fractional order and time-dependent parameters as well asunobserved dynamics of the fractional SEIR model via fractional physics-informed neural networks. Then, we make short-time predictions using the learnedfractional SEIR model.

LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2022.03.060 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic factors andtreatment alternatives of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) in renal transplant patients. METHODS: Three thousand renal transplant patients were included in the study. The patients were first divided into 2 groups. Group 1: ABMR [-]recipients (n = 2871), Group 2: ABMR (+) recipients (n = 129). ABMR patients werecompared among themselves by dividing them into 3 subgroups (early-active,late-active, chronic-active). The study was performed retrospectively. Different combinations of methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab,plasmapheresis (PP), anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) were used in the treatment andthe results were compared. RESULTS: Graft survival and functions were worse andthe rates of CAD, delayed graft function, BK virus, and cytomegalovirus higher inpatients with ABMR. Also, graft survival was lower in patients with serumcreatinine >/=3 (P = 0.001), GFR <30 (P <0.001), and spot urine protein tocreatinine ratio >/=1 (P = 0.042) at the time of diagnosis. High interstitialfibrosis and tubular atrophy scores in chronic ABMR cases and high intimalarteritis scores in active ABMR cases were poor prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that ABMR has a poor prognosis in terms of clinical parameters, and treatment should be individualized according to pathologic findings and graftfunctions at the time of diagnosis. Pulse methylprednisolone and IVIG should beused in the treatment of all ABMR patients, but PP, rituximab, and ATG should be used in selected cases. ABMR has a poor prognosis and treatment should beindividualized.

LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2022.04.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transplant-related hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a rarelyrecognized phenomenon with significant clinical importance given its potential toresult in chronic hepatitis posttransplant. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluatedHEV diagnosis and treatment after liver, kidney, and heart transplant in a singlecenter. We identified patients diagnosed with HEV by serologic testing andevaluated their treatment regimens. RESULTS: Fifteen transplant recipients (12liver, 2 kidney, and 1 heart) presented with elevated liver enzymes and werepositive for HEV IgM antibody. Liver enzymes normalized in 4 patients after beingtreated with ribavirin. One of the 4 patients had 2 recurrences with positive HEVRNA results following ribavirin treatment but recovered after 12 months ofribavirin therapy. After treatment with reduction in immunosuppression withoutantiviral treatment, 6 of 8 patients' liver enzymes normalized. One of thesepatients died of acute pancreatitis 2 months after testing positive for HEV IgMantibody. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for complications related to active HEVinfections in transplant recipients necessitates prompt diagnosis and treatmentto prevent irreversible damage. Diagnosis with HEV reversetranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction should follow a positive HEV IgM antibodytest. This manuscript provides evidence that ribavirin antiviral therapy andreducing immunosuppression are effective treatments for HEV infections in liver, kidney, and heart transplant recipients, which has not been sufficientlyinvestigated in the population of the United States. Larger multicenter studiesare needed to confirm the risks and benefits of using ribavirin antiviral therapyas first-line therapy of HEV posttransplant.

LID - 10.1016/j.identj.2022.06.028 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Odontogenic lesions evolve as a result of altered dental development.This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and the coinfection of Epstein-Barrvirus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in radicular cysts, dentigerous cysts, odontogenic keratocysts, and ameloblastomas. METHODS:Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyse 66 cases of odontogeniclesions for the presence of EBV-DNA and KSHV-DNA. These lesions were 15 radicularcysts, 16 dentigerous cysts, 18 odontogenic keratocysts, and 17 ameloblastomas.RESULTS: EBV-DNA was detected in 24 (36.4%) of the studied samples as follows: 6 samples (40.0%) of radicular cysts, 4 (25.0%) of dentigerous cysts, 10 (55.6 %)of odontogenic keratocysts, and 4 (23.5%) of ameloblastomas (P = .168). KSHV-DNA was found in 16 (24.2%) of the studied samples as follows: 1 sample (6.7%) ofradicular cysts, 6 (37.5%) of dentigerous cysts, 8 (44.4 %) of odontogenickeratocysts, and 1 (5.9%) of ameloblastomas (P = .001). Additionally, EBV andKSHV were positively correlated in all studied samples (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS:Both EBV and KSHV are found in odontogenic cysts and ameloblastomas. KSHV and EBVare more prevalent in odontogenic keratocysts than in other studied odontogeniclesions. Further, there is a high prevalence of EBV and KSHV coinfection inodontogenic cysts and ameloblastomas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalisation of US infantsand an important risk factor for childhood asthma. Recent evidence suggests that bronchiolitis is clinically heterogeneous. We sought to derive bronchiolitisendotypes by integrating clinical, virus and lipidomics data and to examine theirrelationship with subsequent asthma risk. METHODS: This is a multicentreprospective cohort study of infants (age <12 months) hospitalised forbronchiolitis. We identified endotypes by applying clustering approaches toclinical, virus and nasopharyngeal airway lipidomic data measured athospitalisation. We then determined their longitudinal association with the risk for developing asthma by age 6 years by fitting a mixed-effects logisticregression model. To account for multiple comparisons of the lipidomics data, we computed the false discovery rate (FDR). To understand the underlying biological mechanism of the endotypes, we also applied pathway analyses to the lipidomicsdata. RESULTS: Of 917 infants with bronchiolitis (median age, 3 months), weidentified clinically and biologically meaningful lipidomic endotypes: (A)cinical(classic)lipid(mixed) (n=263), (B)clinical(severe)lipid(sphingolipids-high) (n=281), (C)clinical(moderate)lipid(phospholipids-high) (n=212) and (D)clinical(atopic)lipid(sphingolipids-low) (n=161). Endotype A infants werecharacterised by 'classic' clinical presentation of bronchiolitis. Profile Dinfants were characterised by a higher proportion of parental asthma, IgEsensitisation and rhinovirus infection and low sphingolipids (eg, sphingomyelins,ceramides). Compared with endotype A, profile D infants had a significantlyhigher risk of asthma (22% vs 50%; unadjusted OR, 3.60; 95% CI 2.31 to 5.62;p<0.001). Additionally, endotype D had a significantly lower abundance ofpolyunsaturated fatty acids (eg, docosahexaenoic acid; FDR=0.01). The pathwayanalysis revealed that sphingolipid metabolism pathway was differentiallyexpressed in endotype D (FDR=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: In this multicentre prospectivecohort study of infants with bronchiolitis, integrated clustering of clinical,virus and lipidomic data identified clinically and biologically distinctendotypes that have a significantly differential risk for developingasthma.Delete.

AB  - Human RSV is the leading cause of infantile bronchiolitis in the world and one ofthe major causes of childhood deaths in resource-poor settings. It is a majorunmet target for vaccines and anti-viral drugs. Respiratory syncytial virus hasevolved a unique strategy to evade host immune response by coding for twonon-structural proteins NS1 and NS2. Recently it was shown that in infectedcells, nuclear NS1 could be involved in transcription regulation of host geneslinked to innate immune response, via interactions with chromatin and theMediator complex. Here we identified the MED25 Mediator subunit as an NS1interactor in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We demonstrate that NS1 directlyinteracts with MED25 in vitro and in cellula, and that this interaction involves the MED25 transactivator binding ACID domain on the one hand, and the C-terminal alpha3 helix of NS1, with an additional contribution of the globular domain ofNS1, on the other hand. By NMR we show that the NS1 alpha3 sequence primarilybinds to the MED25 ACID H2 face, similarly to the alpha-helical transactivationdomains (TADs) of transcription regulators such as Herpex simplex VP16 andATF6alpha, a master regulator of ER stress response activated upon viralinfection. Moreover, we found out that the NS1 could compete with ATF6alpha TADfor binding to MED25. These findings point to a mechanism of NS1 interfering withinnate immune response by impairing recruitment by cellular TADs of the Mediator via MED25 and hence transcription of specific genes by RNA polymerase II.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family member A1 (ALDH6A1) is associatedwith multiple diseases, but its pathogenesis in colon cancer (CC) is ambiguousand needs further study so that this research explores the function of ALDH6A1 inCC. METHODS: The level of ALDH6A1 in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), CC tissues, andcells was measured by starBase v2.0, quantitative real-time polymerase chainreaction (qRT-PCR), and western blot. Post transfection with overexpressed(oe)-ALDH6A1, cell biological behaviors, as well as apoptosis-, matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP)-, and rat sarcoma virus (RAS)/rapidly acceleratedfibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellularsignal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway-related markers were measured by cellfunction experiments, qRT-PCR, and western blot. Next, the effects of smallinterfering RNA targeting ALDH6A1 (si-ALDH6A1) and RAS/RAF inhibitor (MCP110) on cell biological behaviors, as well as apoptosis-, MMP-, and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERKpathway-related markers were detected again. RESULTS: ALDH6A1 was low-expressedin COAD, CC tissues, and cells . Oe-ALDH6A1 weakened cell vitality, migration andinvasionbut facilitated apoptosis; while it reduced expression levels of Bcl-2,MMP-2, MMP-9 and the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway-related markers but promoted Baxlevel. However, the regulation of si-ALDH6A1 on cell biological behaviors andrelated genes was opposite to that of oe-ALDH6A1. Moreover, MCP110 rescued theregulation of si-ALDH6A1 on cell biological behaviors, expressions of apoptosis- MMP- as well as RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway-related markers. To sum up, ALDH6A1attenuated CC progression by down-regulating the expressions of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERKpathway-related markers.

AB  - The global distribution of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is the subjectof considerable attention because of its pivotal role as a biological vector ofseveral high profile disease pathogens including dengue, chikungunya, yellowfever, and Zika viruses. There is also a lot of interest in the projected future species' distribution. However, less effort has been focused on its historicaldistribution, which has changed substantially over the past 100years, especially in southern Europe where it was once widespread, but largely disappeared by themiddle of the 20th century. The present work utilises all available historicalrecords of the distribution of Ae. aegypti in southern Europe, the Near Eastwithin the Mediterranean Basin and North Africa from the late 19th century until the 1960's to construct a spatial distribution model using matching historicalclimatic and demographic data. The resulting model was then implemented usingcurrent climate and demographic data to assess the potential distribution of the vector in the present. The models were rerun with several different assumptionsabout the thresholds that determine habitat suitability for Ae. aegypti. Thehistorical model matches the historical distributions well. When it is run withcurrent climate values, the predicted present day distribution is somewhatbroader than it used to be particularly in north-west France, North Africa andTurkey. Though it is beginning to reappear in the eastern Caucasus, this'potential' distribution clearly does not match the actual distribution of thespecies, which suggests some other factors are responsible for its absence.Future distributions based on the historical model also do not match futuredistributions derived from models based only on present day vector distributions,which predict little or no presence in the Mediterranean Region. At the sametime, the vector is widespread in the USA which is predicted to consolidate itsrange there in future. This contradiction and the implication for possiblere-invasion of Europe are discussed.

AB  - The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had unprecedented social and economic ramifications. Identifyingtargets for drug repurposing could be an effective means to present new and fast treatments. Furthermore, the risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 goesup when there are coexisting medical conditions, however, the underlyingmechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we have adopted a network-based systems biology approach to investigate the RNA binding proteins (RBPs)-basedmolecular interplay between COVID-19, various human cancers, and neurologicaldisorders. The network based on RBPs commonly involved in the three diseaseconditions consisted of nine RBPs connecting 10 different cancer types, 22 brain disorders, and COVID-19 infection, ultimately hinting at the comorbidities andcomplexity of COVID-19. Further, we underscored five miRNAs with reportedantiviral properties that target all of the nine shared RBPs and are thustherapeutically valuable. As a strategy to improve the clinical conditions incomorbidities associated with COVID-19, we propose perturbing the shared RBPs by drug repurposing. The network-based analysis presented hereby contributes to abetter knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of the comorbidities associatedwith COVID-19.

AB  - Porcine circovirus (PCV) comprises four types, PCV1, PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4, which belong to the Circovirus genus of the family Circoviridae. PCV1 is nonpathogenic,whereas PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4 can infect pigs and cause disease. However, due to alack of experimental evidence, whether vaccines based on PCV capsid (Cap) caninduce cross-reactivity against PCVs remains controversial. In this study,recombinant truncated capsids (rCaps) of PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4 were highly andefficiently expressed and purified, followed by the development and evaluation ofantibodies against PCVs. The results showed that monovalent and trivalentantigens based on the recombinant Caps had adequate immunogenicity to stimulatespecific antibodies against the corresponding protein and virus. Furthermore,antisera prepared from the recombinant Caps also cross-reacted with differentPCVs. Therefore, recombinant proteins can be used as candidate antigens todevelop vaccines and ELISA diagnostic kits. In addition, the antibodies prepared in this study are promising candidates for the simultaneous prevention andtreatment of PCVs in the clinic.

AB  - Theiler's disease (serum hepatitis) may occur in outbreaks or as single cases of acute hepatitis and is often associated with prior administration ofequine-origin biologics approximately 4-10 weeks before the onset of clinicalsigns. Cases have also been described without any prior administration of bloodproducts. The clinical disease has a low morbidity but high mortality and onlyadult horses are affected. The course of the disease is short, with horses eitherdying or completely recovering in a few days. Pathology in affected horses ispredominantly centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis with mononuclear cellinfiltration of the lesser affected periportal regions of the liver. Subclinical cases of the disease also occur. Based on the epidemiology and pathology of thedisease, a viral cause, similar to hepatitis B in humans, has long beensuspected. This paper reviews both historical and recent findings on Theiler'sdisease. Reported epidemics of Theiler's disease in the early 1900s are reviewed,along with their similarities to outbreaks of serum hepatitis in humans followingyellow fever virus vaccinations in the 1930s and 1940s. Recent metagenomics-basedstudies to determine the aetiology of Theiler's disease are discussed, along withboth clinical and experimental findings supporting equine parvovirus-hepatitis(EqPV-H) as the likely cause of this 100-year-old disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabies kills around 60 000 people each year. ChAdOx2 RabG, a simianadenovirus-vectored rabies vaccine candidate, might have potential to providelow-cost single-dose pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis. This first-in-human studyaimed to evaluate its safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults. METHODS: Wedid a single-centre phase 1 study of ChAdOx2 RabG, administered as a singleintramuscular dose, with non-randomised open-label dose escalation at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Oxford, UK. Healthy adults weresequentially allocated to groups receiving low (5 x 10(9) viral particles),middle (2.5 x 10(10) viral particles), and high doses (5 x 10(10) viralparticles) of ChAdOx2 RabG and were followed up to day 56 after vaccination. The primary objective was to assess safety. The secondary objective was to assessimmunogenicity with the internationally standardised rabies virus neutralisingantibody assay. In an optional follow-up phase 1 year after enrolment, wemeasured antibody maintenance then administered a licensed rabies vaccine (tosimulate post-exposure prophylaxis) and measured recall responses. The trial isregistered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04162600, and is now closed to newparticipants. FINDINGS: Between Jan 2 and Oct 28, 2020, 12 adults received low(n=3), middle (n=3), and high doses (n=6) of ChAdOx2 RabG. Participants reported predominantly mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. There were no serious adverseevents. Virus neutralising antibody concentrations exceeded the recognisedcorrelate of protection (0.5 IU/mL) in three middle-dose recipients and sixhigh-dose recipients within 56 days of vaccination (median 18.0 IU/mL). Themedian peak virus neutralising antibody concentrations within 56 days were 0.7IU/mL (range 0.0-54.0 IU/mL) for the low-dose group, 18.0 IU/mL (0.7-18.0 IU/mL) for the middle-dose group, and 18.0 IU/mL (6.0-486.0 IU/mL) for the high-dosegroup. Nine participants returned for the additional follow-up after 1 year. Ofthese nine participants, virus neutralising antibody titres of more than 0.5IU/mL were maintained in six of seven who had received middle-dose or high-doseChAdOx2 RabG. Within 7 days of administration of the first dose of a licensedrabies vaccine, nine participants had virus neutralising antibody titres of more than 0.5 IU/mL. INTERPRETATION: In this study, ChAdOx2 RabG showed an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and encouraging immunogenicity, supportingfurther clinical evaluation.

AB  - The sleep-wakefulness cycle is regulated by complicated neural networks thatinclude many different populations of neurons throughout the brain. Argininevasopressin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH(AVP))regulate various physiological events and behaviors, such as body-fluidhomeostasis, blood pressure, stress response, social interaction, and feeding.Changes in arousal level often accompany these PVH(AVP)-mediated adaptiveresponses. However, the contribution of PVH(AVP) neurons to sleep-wakefulnessregulation has remained unknown. Here, we report the involvement of PVH(AVP)neurons in arousal promotion. Optogenetic stimulation of PVH(AVP) neurons rapidlyinduced transitions to wakefulness from both NREM and REM sleep. This arousaleffect was dependent on AVP expression in these neurons. Similarly, chemogenetic activation of PVH(AVP) neurons increased wakefulness and reduced NREM and REMsleep, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons significantly reducedwakefulness and increased NREM sleep. We observed dense projections of PVH(AVP)neurons in the lateral hypothalamus with potential connections toorexin/hypocretin (LH(Orx)) neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of PVH(AVP) neuronalfibers in the LH immediately induced wakefulness, whereas blocking orexinreceptors attenuated the arousal effect of PVH(AVP) neuronal activationdrastically. Monosynaptic rabies-virus tracing revealed that PVH(AVP) neuronsreceive inputs from multiple brain regions involved in sleep-wakefulnessregulation, as well as those involved in stress response and energy metabolism.Moreover, PVH(AVP) neurons mediated the arousal induced by novelty stress and amelanocortin receptor agonist melanotan-II. Thus, our data suggested thatPVH(AVP) neurons promote wakefulness via LH(Orx) neurons in the basalsleep-wakefulness and some stressful conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To detect human metapneumovirus, tests besides reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab specimensare less accessible. Immunochromatography assays are rapid and simple without theneed of any special equipment but sometimes are insufficiently sensitive. Thisstudy describes the usefulness of immunochromatography assays to detect humanmetapneumovirus in adult patients with human metapneumovirus-related acute lower respiratory tract infection using sputum specimens. METHODS: This prospectivesingle-center study enrolled adults and adolescents aged >/=16 years with signsand symptoms of an acute respiratory illness who were diagnosed with acute lower respiratory tract infection. The presence of human metapneumovirus infection was confirmed by seroconversion. Immunochromatography assays and real-time RT-PCRwere performed to compare the efficacy of nasopharyngeal swab specimens andsputum specimens. Comparative results were obtained via McNemar's test. RESULTS: Overall, 337 patients were recruited in this study; 63 (18.7%) patients wereseroconverted. Sputum specimens showed significantly higher positivity rates thannasopharyngeal swab specimens with both immunochromatography assays (p = 0.0008) and real-time RT-PCR (p = 0.014). Among 29 patients with pneumonia who hadconcordant positive real-time RT-PCR results for both nasopharyngeal swabspecimens and sputum specimens, 21 (72.4%) had a higher viral load in the sputum specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Sputum specimens are more useful in detecting humanmetapneumovirus than nasopharyngeal swab specimens in adult patients with acutelower respiratory tract infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) in children hasbeen insufficiently elucidated upon. Our aims were to develop subgenomic (sg)mRNA tests for HCoV species OC43 and NL63, and to evaluate the relationships toHCoV genomic loads, single HCoV detections and clinical manifestations. METHODS: We have used an 11-yearlong cohort study of children admitted with respiratorytract infection (RTI) and hospital controls. Nasopharyngeal aspirates wereanalyzed for HCoV subtypes OC43 and NL63 with in-house diagnostic PCR. Positivesamples were tested with newly developed real-time PCRs targeting sg mRNA coding for the nucleocapsid protein. RESULTS: OC43 sg mRNA was detected in 86% (105/122)of available OC43-positive samples in the RTI group, and in 63% (12/19) ofcontrol samples. NL63 sg mRNA was detected in 72% (71/98) and 71% (12/17) ofavailable NL63-positive patient and control samples, respectively. In RTIsamples, sg mRNA detection was strongly associated with a Ct value <32 in bothdiagnostic PCR tests (OC43: OR = 54, 95% CI [6.8-428]; NL63: OR = 42, 95% CI[9.0-198]) and single NL63 detections (OR = 6.9, 95% CI [1.5-32]). Comparing RTI and controls, only OC43 was associated with RTI when adjusted for age (aOR = 3.2,95% CI [1.1-9.4]). CONCLUSION: We found strong associations between OC43 and NL63sg mRNA and high viral genomic loads. sg mRNA for OC43 was associated with RTI.The association between sg mRNA and clinical manifestations needs furtherevaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is the cause of a severehemorrhagic fever with cases reported throughout a wide-geographic region. Spreadby the bite of infected ticks, contact with infected livestock or in the healthcare setting, disease begins as a non-specific febrile illness that can rapidlyprogress to hemorrhagic manifestations. Currently, there are no approved vaccinesand antivirals such as ribavirin have unclear efficacy. Thus treatment is mostly limited to supportive care. METHODS: In this report we evaluated analphavirus-based replicon RNA vaccine expressing either the CCHFV nucleoproteinor glycoprotein precursor in a stringent, heterologous lethal challenge mousemodel. FINDINGS: Vaccination with the RNA expressing the nucleoprotein alonecould confer complete protection against clinical disease, but vaccination with acombination of both the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein precursor afforded robust protection against disease and viral replication. Protection from lethalchallenge required as little as a single immunization with 100ng of RNA.Unexpectedly, analysis of the immune responses elicited by the vaccine componentsshowed that vaccination resulted in antibodies against the internal viralnucleoprotein and cellular immunity against the virion-exposed glycoproteins.INTERPRETATION: Cumulatively this vaccine conferred robust protection againstCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and supports continued development of this vaccine candidate. FUNDING: This research was supported by the IntramuralResearch Program of the NIAID/NIH and HDT Bio.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: The aim of the study is to experimentally test the process ofviral infection and determine the ways of its penetration into the human body.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: This experimental analysis is based on systematic research, published peer-reviewed articles, books, textbooks,monographs. It should also be noted that in order to identify someimmunocompetent lymph node cells and the ability to visualize certain sites inthe lymphoid nodes of Peyer's patches, where the initial processes are presented below, we resorted to sampling anatomical material. The study involved 10 adultalbino rats weighing 200.0 +/- 20.0 g. The search period covered the period from 2010 to 2021, but the experimental analysis contains some valuable data fromprevious years, as these literature sources have significant scientific value.RESULTS: Results: According to immunohistochemical analysis of the epitheliumassociated with the dome of the lymph nodes of the small intestine of white rats,the bulk was B-lymphocytes (about 47%) and T-lymphocytes (about 35%), whileplasma cells, macrophages and dendritic cells accounted for approximately 5% for each of them. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: capital ER, Cyrillicrocess of development of viral infection can be represented in the form of the following targetedsteps: 1) massive invasion of viruses into the body; 2) the pathway of viruses tothe intended target (target cells) is carried out by the blood flow; 3) small a, Cyrillicchieving the target by viruses and their penetration into target cells.capital I, Ukrainiann the pathogenesis of viral diseases, the role is played bythe preparedness of the particular body, which directly depends on the functionalstate of its immune system, which determines the possibility, severity andoutcome of the disease.

LID - 10.36740/WLek202206103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: Study of clinical manifestations and management of patientswith COVID toes and fingers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 1,841patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized. Allpatients were divided into two groups: without surgical pathology - 1,693(91.96%) and with surgical pathology (patients with COVID toes and fingers andabdominal syndrome) - 148 (8.04%). The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made on thebasis of clinical data, laboratory test results (PCR test for SARS-CoV-2) andcomputed tomography of the chest. On admission, in addition to the generallaboratory tests, mandatory special methods of examination included determinationof D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 (IL-6).RESULTS: Results: Surgical ischemic manifestations were observed in 8.04% of all patients with COVID-19, of which 86.48% presented with ischemic abdominalsyndrome and 13.52% with COVID toes and fingers. C-reactive protein andprocalcitonin are the markers that may indicate the development of ischemicsurgical problems. A direct statistically significant linear correlation wasfound between the severity of the underlying disease and the mean D-dimer (r =0.815; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The confirmed phenomenon of COVID toesand fingers does not require active surgical tactics. It is necessary to conduct pathogenetic treatment of COVID-19 and dynamic monitoring of its clinical course.

TI  - Thrombosis leading to acute abdomen in corona virus disease- 19:A case series.
LID - 10.1007/s12664-022-01260-5 [doi]
AB  - Involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) system in corona virus disease-19(COVID-19) in form of diarrhea, loss of taste, nausea, and anorexia is common andassociated with poor prognosis. COVID-19 is also associated with ahypercoagulable state that mainly involves the pulmonary vasculature. However, GIcomplications involving thrombosis are observed infrequently. We report twoCOVID-19 patients who had two different causes of acute abdomen. The firstpatient was a 49-year-old male diagnosed with an aortic thrombus along with asplenic infarct. He was diagnosed early and successfully managed withanticoagulants. The second patient was a 30-year-old male who developed pain inthe abdomen and was found to have features suggestive of peritonitis. Acontrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) scan of the abdomen revealeddilated bowel loops. Immediate exploratory laparotomy was performed; he was foundto have jejunal perforation with gangrene. Histopathological examination of theresected specimen showed inflammatory cells with edema and thrombotic vessels.However, he succumbed to sepsis and multiorgan failure. Therefore, it isimportant to investigate cases of acute abdomen in COVID-19 thoroughly andwhenever indicated CT angiogram should be obtained.

TI  - Patterns of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV Among Blood Donors in Samtah-JazanRegion.
LID - 10.1007/s44197-022-00051-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Transfusion-transmitted infectious agents are amongstthe major health burden worldwide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) among blood donors in Samtah General Hospital, Jazanregion, Saudi Arabia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, blooddonation records of all blood donors recruited between January 2019 and August2020 were included for data acquisition. A total of 4977 blood donors' recordswere reviewed and data were analysed. RESULTS: Hepatitis B profile showed 0.60%blood donors positive for hepatis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Nucleic acid testing(NAT) showed the presence of HBV-DNA in 0.4% of the blood donors. Anti-HBs andanti-HBc antibodies were reactive in 3.34% and 7.31% blood donors' units,respectively. Anti-HCV antibodies were reactive among 54 (1.09%) blood donors.Upon reviewing the NAT analysis results, 0.16% (08) blood donors showed thepresence of HCV-RNA in their blood units. Anti-HIV antibodies were reactive in 8 (0.16%) blood donors. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the frequency of HBsAg is comparatively lower while anti-HCV positivity is higher in Samtah, Jazan as aregion compared to other regions of the country. Further studies are warranted toevaluate the cause of HCV infection in this area. Frequency of HIV is uncommon inthis area.

TI  - Induction of Cross-Reacting Antibodies Against the COVID-19 by BCG Vaccination inthe Mouse Model.

LID - 10.1007/s00284-022-02971-w [doi]
AB  - It was reported that tuberculosis and BCG vaccination are potential tools forreducing the burden of COVID-19, mainly through the non-specific trainedimmunity. We have investigated whether BCG vaccination is able to inducecross-reacting antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2. We have tested the inducedhumoral immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the mouse model, aftereither BCG or rabies DNA-based vaccination alone or in Prime/Boost approach toCOVID-19 DNA-based vaccination. We have demonstrated that BCG vaccination alonewas able to induce cross-reacting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike. It can alsoboost the antibody response induced by a COVID-19 DNA-based vaccination. Hence,both BCG and latent tuberculosis infection can explain the lower burden ofCOVID-19 in developing countries, not only through the trained immunity but also by inducing cross-reacting antibodies. Furthermore, with the emergence ofdifferent COVID-19 variants, or eventually other Betacoronaviruses, the use ofBCG vaccination can help against immune escapes of the current vaccines.

LID - 10.1007/s11250-022-03237-0 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this work are, firstly, to provide the geolocalization of cases ofbovine abortion with definitive diagnosis and, secondly, to estimate the economiclosses due to the most frequent abortifacients diagnosed agents in cattle inBuenos Aires province, Argentina. The total beef and dairy cattle population atrisk of abortion is 8,358,186 and 538,076, respectively. In beef cattle, theoverall risk of abortion was estimated at 4.5% for all pregnancies, where 27.9%are due to Campylobacter fetus, Neospora caninum, Leptospira spp., Brucellaabortus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus with economic losses of US$ 440 perabortion, being the annual loss to the beef industry of US$ 50,144,101. In dairy cattle, there was an 8.0% risk of suffering abortion, 26.1% produced by the same abortigenic agents. The economic losses were estimated at US$ 1,415 per abortion,which equals a total loss of US$ 17,298,498 for the dairy industry in the region.The results of this study show that infectious causes are highly prevalent inBuenos Aires province, and they caused severe economic impacts in the dairy andbeef industries. Furthermore, changes in temporal trends of infectious abortionoccurrence were detected, probably related to the inclusion of moleculardiagnostic techniques with more sensitivity or different epidemiological orhusbandry conditions in the region analyzed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Widespread and prolonged therapy with ganciclovir (GCV) may result inthe emergence of GCV-resistant mutations in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome. The aim of this study was to detect the UL97 mutations associated with GCVresistance in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: Forty-nine kidney recipientswith positive HCMV DNAemia, who received GCV therapy were included in this study.A 707 bp fragment of UL97 gene spanning codons (436 to 655) was amplified bynested PCR and sequenced. RESULTS: Thirteen (26.5 %) out of 49 recipientscontained mutations associated with amino acid changes. Two UL97 mutationsrelated to GCV resistance were detected in 2 recipients (4 %), including alanine to valine (A594V) and proline to leucine (P521L). The D605E mutation wasidentified in 8 out of 49 (16.3 %) recipients. Silent mutations G598G, G503G,L553L, L634L, D456D and G579G were commonly observed. CONCLUSION: Our resultsindicate that mutations in the UL97 gene associated with GCV resistance may occurin 1 in 25 recipients treated with GCV. In addition, a higher mutation rate ofD605E was detected in our recipients. This study provides the first evidence ofthe prevalence and pattern of GCV related mutations in Iranian Turkish recipients(Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 28).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of factors suchas age, gender, comorbid diseases and treatments applied on the positive durationof the PCR test in COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: The duration of PCR positivity in COVID-19 patients varies. Studies in the literature investigating factors thatmay affect this duration are limited. METHODS: Between March and September 2020, individuals with two or more positive PCR results with a 14-day interval wereincluded in the case group, and those whose PCR results turned negative within 14days were included in the control group. The relationship between age, gender,contact environment, presence of additional disease, drugs used, smoking andalcohol consumption; type, duration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms, treatment applied for COVID-19 and duration of PCR positivity were examined. RESULTS: Among126 participants the mean duration of PCR positivity was 23.38 days (min 6, max52). Symptoms lasted 15-30 days in 41 patients (32.5 %) and 5-10 days in 30patients (23.8 %). The positivity duration varied according to age, smoking andalcohol consumption status, and body mass index. Patients with chronic disease,and who had loss of taste and smell during the disease had a longer positivestay. This period was shorter in favipiravir users. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19infection, there are several factors that affect the PCR test to remain positive.Early-term favipiravir use may shorten this period as a modifiable factor (Tab.3, Ref. 14).

AB  - BACKGROUND: This survey was aimed to obtain the characteristics of physiciansoperating in mass vaccination sites (MVS), emphasizing their motivation to workthere. METHOD: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional internet-based surveyinvolving physicians operating in MVS during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thequestionnaire comprised demographic characteristics and questions regarding theperception of physicians working in MVS. RESULTS: In total, 140 questionnaireresponses were analysed. There were 98 female (70 %) and 42 male (30 %)physicians. Fifty-five were residents (39.3 %), and 85 were attending physicians (60.7 %). As the main motivation for participating in MVS, residents (43.6 %)reported a financial benefit, while moral responsibility was more common inattending physicians (50.6 %), (p0.05). Physician burnout was more prevalent (32 %) in those study participants, who worked in MVS as part of their work duty. 48 % of these physicians expressed no willingness to work in MVS in the future. All the respondents, who reported the professional experience as their mainmotivation to work in MVS expressed their will to work in MVS again. CONCLUSIONS:The financial aspect was the most important motivational factor among residents, while moral responsibility was decisive for the attending physicians. Physicians,who participated in MVS as a work duty presented both the most prevalentself-perceived burnout syndrome (32 %) and the hesitancy (48 %) to work in MVSagain in the future (Tab. 4, Ref. 15) Keywords: mass vaccination site, COVID-19; healthcare workers, vaccination, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus.

TI  - Association of hepatitis B virus DNA levels with overall survival for advancedhepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma under immune checkpointinhibitor therapy.
LID - 10.1007/s00262-022-03254-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level is an independent risk factor for postoperative HBV-associated liver cancer recurrence. We sought to examinewhether HBV DNA level and antiviral therapy are associated with survival outcomesin patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated withanti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)based immunotherapy. METHODS: Thissingle-institution retrospective analysis included 217 patients with advancedHBV-related HCC treated from 1 June 2018, through 30 December 2020. Baselineinformation was compared between patients with low and high HBV DNA levels.Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared, andunivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to identify potential riskfactors for oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: The 217 patients included in theanalysis had a median survival time of 20.6 months. Of these HBV-associated HCCpatients, 165 had known baseline HBV DNA levels. Baseline HBV DNA level was notsignificantly associated with OS (P = 0.59) or PFS (P = 0.098). Compared topatients who did not receive antiviral therapy, patients who received antiviraltherapy had significantly better OS (20.6 vs 11.1 months, P = 0.020), regardless of HBV DNA levels. Moreover, antiviral status (adjusted HR = 0.24, 95% CI0.094-0.63, P = 0.004) was an independent protective factor for OS in amultivariate analysis of patients with HBV-related HCC. CONCLUSIONS: HBV viralload does not compromise the clinical outcome of patients with HBV-related HCCtreated with anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy. The use of antiviral therapysignificantly improves survival time of HBV-related HCC patients.

TI  - Prevalence of individual brain and eye defects potentially related to Zika virus in pregnancy in 22 U.S. states and territories, January 2016 to June 2017.
LID - 10.1002/bdr2.2067 [doi]
AB  - During the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Zika Virus Response,birth defects surveillance programs adapted to monitor birth defects potentially related to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomesoccurring during January 2016 to June 2017 in 22 U.S. states and territories wereused to estimate the prevalence of those brain and eye defects potentiallyrelated to ZIKV. Jurisdictions were divided into three groups: areas withwidespread ZIKV transmission, areas with limited local ZIKV transmission, andareas without local ZIKV transmission. Prevalence estimates for selected brainand eye defects and microcephaly per 10,000 live births were estimated.Prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated usingPoisson regression for areas with widespread and limited ZIKV transmissioncompared with areas without local ZIKV transmission. Defects with significantlyhigher prevalence in areas of widespread transmission were pooled, and PRs werecalculated by quarter, comparing subsequent quarters to the first quarter(January-March 2016). Nine defects had significantly higher prevalence in areasof widespread transmission. The highest PRs were seen in intracranialcalcifications (PR = 12.6, 95% CI [7.4, 21.3]), chorioretinal abnormalities (12.5[7.1, 22.3]), brainstem abnormalities (9.3 [4.7, 18.4]), and cerebral/corticalatrophy (6.7 [4.2, 10.8]). The PR of the nine pooled defects was significantlyhigher in three quarters in areas with widespread transmission. The largestdifference in prevalence was observed for defects consistently reported ininfants with congenital ZIKV infection. Birth defects surveillance programs couldconsider monitoring a subset of birth defects potentially related to ZIKV inpregnancy.

PG  - 10600280221114469
LID - 10.1177/10600280221114469 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this article is to review the immunogenicity andsafety of the 3-antigen recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (3A-HepB) in adults. DATASOURCES: A literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar (2000 to June 2022) with the search terms hepatitis B vaccine and 3-antigen. Otherresources included the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, conferenceabstracts of liver meetings, the prescribing information, and the manufacturer's website. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles ofstudies assessing the immunogenicity and safety of 3A-HepB in humans wereincluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 3A-HepB is licensed to prevent infection caused by all known subtypes of the hepatitis B virus in adults. It contains 3 hepatitis B surface antigens. The 3A-HepB has been shown to be noninferior to asingle-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (1A-HepB). It is administered intramuscularly as a 3-dose series at 0, 1, and 6 months. The most commonly reported localreactions were injection site pain and tenderness, and the most commonly reportedsystemic reactions were headache, fatigue, and myalgia. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CAREAND CLINICAL PRACTICE: The introduction of 3A-HepB represents another step towardreducing the rates of new hepatitis B infections. However, clinical trials areneeded to assess the immunogenicity of 3A-HepB in individuals at high-risk ofnonresponse or low response to 1A-HepB, such as those with renal or hepaticimpairment and those with altered immunocompetence. CONCLUSIONS: The 3A-HepBrepresents another vaccine to prevent hepatitis B in adults. It is safe andimmunogenic but is associated with more adverse reactions than 1A-HepB.

TI  - Characterizing Complex Populations of Endogenous Adeno-associated Viruses bySingle-Genome Amplification.
LID - 10.1089/hum.2022.099 [doi]
AB  - The isolation of adeno-associated virus (AAV) genomes from biomaterials at themolecular level has traditionally relied on polymerase chain reaction-based andcloning-based techniques. However, when applied to samples containing multiplespecies, traditional techniques for isolating viral genomes can amplifyartificial recombinants and introduce polymerase misincorporation errors. Here,we describe AAV single-genome amplification (AAV-SGA): a powerful technique toisolate, amplify, and sequence single AAV genomes from mammalian genomic DNA,which can then be used to construct vectors for gene therapy. We used AAV-SGA to precisely isolate 15 novel AAV genomes belonging AAV clades A, D, and E and theFringe outgroup. This technique also enables investigations of AAV populationdynamics and recombination events to provide insights into virus-hostinteractions and virus biology. Using AAV-SGA, we identified regionalheterogeneity within AAV populations from different lobes of the liver of arhesus macaque and found evidence of frequent genomic recombination between AAVpopulations. This study highlights the strengths of AAV-SGA and demonstrates its capability to provide valuable insights into the biology and diversity of AAVs.

AB  - The development of full-length infectious cDNA clones for plant RNA viruses isimportant for studying their molecular biological characteristics, functionalgenomics, pathogenesis, and vectorization applications. Citrus mosaic virus(CiMV), a member of Sadwavirus, is of economic importance to the citrus industry and comprises a bipartite, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomeencapsidated in icosahedral virions. In the present study, full-length cDNAclones of CiMV RNA1 and RNA2 were constructed based on a ternaryyeast-Escherichia coli-Agrobacterium tumefaciens shuttle vector, pTY, usingtransformation-associated recombination (TAR) strategy. Infectivity of cDNAclones of CiMV RNA1 and RNA2 was examined in multiple citrus varieties viaAgrobacterium-mediated vacuum-infiltration (AVI) through symptom observation,RT-PCR, and virion detection with an electron microscope. Furthermore, thegenome-sized RT-PCR fragments of RNA1 and RNA2 were obtained from symptomaticJinchengyou (Citrus grandis) plants infected by the cloned virus (CiMV211). Inaddition, CiMV211 produced typical symptoms of wild-type CiMV in cowpea (Vignaangularis) plants inoculated by Agrobacterium-mediated injection. This is thefirst report of infectious cDNA clones of CiMV, which may lay the foundation for research on the pathogenesis and vectorization of the virus.

PG  - 60
LID - 10.1186/s13567-022-01079-0 [doi]
AB  - Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) belong to the Retroviridae family and cancause various diseases. One of the most impacting diseases is visna-maedi, acomplex disease characterized by long latencies and chronic progressiveinflammatory events affecting the nervous system, lungs, mammary gland, andarticular joints. A single nucleotide polymorphism (rs408593969, c.103G>A,missense mutation E35K) in the ovine transmembrane protein gene 154 (TMEM154) wasidentified as protective against small ruminant lentivirus infection in differentherds worldwide. However, there is evidence in the scientific literature of abreed-specificity of this protective effect and, furthermore, there are stilllimited studies regarding the association between the animal genotype and theinfecting virus genotype. Thus, the aim of this study was to further investigate the association between the animal genotype for the suggested protective mutationand the infecting virus genotype, in three different sheep breeds reared innorthern Italy. The results obtained only partially confirmed the data available in the literature, as the protective effect was confirmed only for SRLV genotype A clusters, while other genotypes (namely B and E) infected AA and GA animals.Further studies with an experimental infection of specific virus genotypes inhosts with specific genotypes are required to confirm the larger number of cases the results obtained in this study.

TI  - Dual contraceptives and associated predictors in HIV positive women: acase-control study.
PG  - 168
LID - 10.1186/s12978-022-01475-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People living with the human immune deficiency virus (PLHIV) are animportant group to address HIV prevention. Mostly, 90% of the HIV cases inchildren are usually through mother-to-child transmission. Dual contraception(barrier condoms i.e., male, and female condoms) are one of the most effectiveways to avoid HIV transmission. Thus, the present study was carried out toestablish the predictors associated with the use of dual contraceptives insexually active HIV positive women in Hossana, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: Aninstitution based unmatched case-control study among randomly selected 312sexually active HIV positive women was conducted from February 2021 to May 2021. The data were collected through structured questionnaire and anti-retroviraltreatment (ART) cards considering the case-to-control ratio of 1:3. Theinformation was coded, entered into Epi-Info7.0 and exported to SPSS 20.0 forfurther analysis. A P-value < 0.25 in bi-variate analysis was further processedfor multi-variate analysis and P-value < 0.05 was considered statisticallysignificant. RESULTS: A response rate of 97.2% was recorded. A significantdifference was observed towards the use of dual contraceptives in sexually activeHIV positive women living in urban vs rural areas (AOR = 0.28; 95% CI =0.09-0.84), having sexual intercourse with a regular partner (AOR = 3.77; 95% CI = 1.48-9.55) and taking first initiation to use (AOR = 0.05; 95% CI = 0.02-0.11).CONCLUSION: The determinants associated with lower use of dual contraceptiveswere residing in rural areas, sexual intercourse with a regular partner and lowinitiation rate at first time for use of dual contraceptives. Therefore, westrongly recommend that open discussion about sexually transmitted infectionslike HIV and their prevention, providing adequate facilities in rural areas canhelp to prevent HIV transmission and reduce the disease burden. The healthprofessionals are encouraged to organize awareness campaigns in rural areas foruse of dual contraceptives among PLHIV.

OAB - HIV/AIDS has become a serious global threat to human beings. People living withHIV are an important group that needs attention. About 90% of the children getHIV infection through their mothers that involved mother-to-child transmission ofHIV. Therefore, World Health Organization has focused on the use of condoms toprevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and to avoidunwanted pregnancies. Out of these contraceptives, the use of dual contraceptiveshas been considered the best to prevent the transmission of STDs/HIV. Therefore, the present study tried to identify the use of dual contraceptives (barriercondoms i.e., male, and female condoms) and factors associated with its use insexually active HIV women in Hossana, SNNPR, Ethiopia. We conducted acase-control study and recruited 312 sexually active HIV positive women that wereon antiretroviral therapy and visiting the ART clinics for their follow-ups. The present investigation revealed that women living in rural areas were not awareabout the use of dual contraceptives when compared to urban areas. Also, it wasobserved that women, those involved in sexual activities with multiple partnersand had an open discussion with their partners about using dual contraceptives atfirst were more when compared to others. Although, the use of dual contraceptivesamong HIV positive women living in Hossana was low. Hence, this needs morefocused awareness programs in rural areas and people having sexual intercoursewith regular partners.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HPV (human papillomavirus) is an important cause of cervical cancer. Cervical-vaginal infection with pathogens, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV),bacterial vaginosis Trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal candidiasis could be acofactor. This study aimed to assess the relationship between vaginal infectionwith HPV genotype and cytology test results and analyze the relationship between vaginal and HPV infections and cervical cancer. METHODS: We performed adistrict-based study to elucidate the relationship among the vaginal and HPVinfections and cervical cancer. We collected the cervical exfoliation data of23,724 women admitted to the Shanghai Zhoupu Hospital and received ThinPrepcytology test (TCT) and HPV detection between 2014 and 2019. RESULTS: Totalvaginal infection rate was 5.3%, and the HPV-positive group had a slightly highervaginal infection rate than the HPV-negative group (P < 0.01). The incidence rateof cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer with vaginal infectionwas higher than without vaginal infection (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: HPV/vaginalinfection-positive women tended to have abnormal results of TCT. Women withvaginal infection were more likely to develop HPV infection. HSV combined withHPV infection was noted as a causal factor for HSIL.

PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/s40359-022-00892-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Patients suffering from post-COVID syndrome, in addition tophysical limitations, cognitive limitations, fatigue, dyspnea as well asdepression and anxiety disorders may also be present. Up to now (as of May 2022),approx. 514 million people worldwide have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, inGermany this affects approx. 25 million. In Germany, 2.5 million people couldpotentially be affected by post-COVID syndrome. Post-COVID is thus a highlyrelevant public health issue. So far, there is no specific causal therapy for thepost-COVID syndrome, but with multimodal symptom-oriented rehabilitation, thecourse can be favourably influenced. However, there is no study yet that focuses on patients in different rehabilitation indications and compares the focalsymptomatology and coping strategies as well as the patients' benefit perindication. METHODS/DESIGN: As first objective, pulmonal, cardiac, neurological, cognitive or/and psychological functional impairments in rehabilitation patients after COVID-19 disease will be described. The second objective is thedifferentiated review of the specific rehabilitation measures, in the short term and in the longer term for the purpose of future prognoses and optimisation oftherapeutic interventions. This prospective, non-randomised, controlledlongitudinal study, plus multi-group comparisons will take place in sevenrehabilitation clinics of different specialisations: cardiological rehab,pneumological rehab, neurological rehab, psychosomatic rehab. Within 12 months,1000 cases across all participating centres will be included. Somatic andpsychological testing will be conducted at three measurement points: Admission(t0), discharge (t1), 6-montas Catamnesis (t2). The patients receive the usualcare according to the respective rehabilitation priorities, adapted to thespecial challenges of post-COVID symptoms. Patients of the post-COVID outpatient clinic without rehabilitation will be used as a control group. DISCUSSION: Thisstudy will precisely assess the extent to which subclinical neurological or/andpsychological impairments are present in post-COVID-19 rehabilitation and theresults will help, developing, providing and evaluating appropriate treatmentconcepts. This may also have relevant implications for the improvement ofphysical ability and quality of life in post-COVID-19 patients and increase theprobability of return to work.

AB  - The ongoing investigations into clusters of children affected by severe acutehepatitis of unknown aetiology have put our global capacity for a coordinated,effective response to the test. The global health community have rapidly convenedto share data and inform the response. In the UK, where most cases were initiallyidentified, a coordinated public health and clinical research response wasrapidly initiated. Since then, cases have been reported from other countries,predominantly from higher-income countries. While agencies are keeping an openmind to the cause, the working hypothesis and case notifications raise important questions about our capacity to detect emerging cases in lower-resourced settingswith a recognised lack of access to diagnostics even for commonly circulatingviruses such as hepatitis A. The limited capability to generate integrated globalpathogen surveillance data is a challenge for the outbreak investigations,highlighting an urgent need to strengthen access to diagnostics, with a focus on lower-resourced settings, to improve the capacity to detect emerging diseases to inform care and to improve outcomes and outbreak control.

TI  - Molecular characterization of a novel subgenotype of lumpy skin disease virusstrain isolated in Inner Mongolia of China.
PG  - 295
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03383-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of Lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle caused by LSDvirus (LSDV) was first reported in August 2019 in China. Since then, several LSD outbreaks have been reported in seven different provinces of China. Until now,several Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) strains from China have been reported andsequenced including LSDV/Xinjiang/2019 (MN598005.1), China/GD01/2020(MW355944.1), and LSDV/Hongkong/2021 (MW732649.1). In October 2020, more than1,700 cattle imported from Chile arrived in Xilingol, Inner Mongolia, and werediagnosed with LSD. Currently, limited data on the origin of the virus isavailable. METHODS: Nucleotide sequences of the ORF11, ORF36, ORF74, ORF117,ORF126 genes and the complete genome of LSDV strains and isolates were downloadedfrom NCBI database. MEGA7.0 was used to perform phylogenetic analysis withNeighbor-Joining (NJ). DNASTAR software is used to analyze homologous comparison analysis with related genes of reference strains included in Genbank. RESULTS:Compared with other strains isolated from China, the results of full genomesequence analysis showed the LSDV/NMG/2020 strain belonged to the recombinantstrains. The LSDV/NMG/2020 strain is different from the current LSDV fieldisolates in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the newly emerged LSDV Russiavariants. Based on the identities of P32, RPO30, EEV, GPCR and LSDV117 genes(99.8%, 99%, 99.8%, 99% and 98.7%), the sub-cluster recombinant containingLSDV/NMG/2020 strain is phylogenetically closer to the Russia strain(Saratov/2017). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we reported a new isolated LSDVstrain named LSDV/NMG/2020. The results of genomic characterization andphylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the LSDV/NMG/2020 isolate was avaccine-like recombinant strain.

TI  - Toosendanin activates caspase-1 and induces maturation of IL-1beta to inhibittype 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replication via anIFI16-dependent pathway.
PG  - 61
LID - 10.1186/s13567-022-01077-2 [doi]
AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a prevalent andendemic swine pathogen which causes significant economic losses in the globalswine industry. Multiple vaccines have been developed to prevent PRRSV infection.However, they provide limited protection. Moreover, no effective therapeuticdrugs are yet available. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novelantiviral strategies to prevent PRRSV infection and transmission. Here we report that Toosendanin (TSN), a tetracyclic triterpene found in the bark or fruits ofMelia toosendan Sieb. et Zucc., strongly suppressed type 2 PRRSV replication invitro in Marc-145 cells and ex vivo in primary porcine alveolar macrophages(PAMs) at sub-micromolar concentrations. The results of transcriptomics revealed that TSN up-regulated the expression of IFI16 in Marc-145 cells. Furthermore, we found that IFI16 silencing enhanced the replication of PRRSV in Marc-145 cellsand that the anti-PRRSV activity of TSN was dampened by IFI16 silencing,suggesting that the inhibition of TSN against PRRSV replication isIFI16-dependent. In addition, we showed that TSN activated caspase-1 and induced maturation of IL-1beta in an IFI16-dependent pathway. To verify the role ofIL-1beta in PRRSV infection, we analyzed the effect of exogenous rmIL-1beta onPRRSV replication, and the results showed that exogenous IL-1beta significantlyinhibited PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells and PAMs in a dose-dependentmanner. Altogether, our findings indicate that TSN significantly inhibits PRRSVreplication at very low concentrations (EC50: 0.16-0.20 muM) and may provideopportunities for developing novel anti-PRRSV agents.

PG  - 456
LID - 10.1186/s12887-022-03420-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the views of adolescents returning to secondaryschool during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In September 2020, the UKHealth Security Agency (UKHSA), formerly known as Public Health England(PHE),recruited staff and students in secondary schools to provide nasal swabs,oral fluid and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody testing.Students aged 11-18 years in five London schools completed a short questionnaire about their perception of the pandemic, returning to school, risk to themselvesand to others and infection control measures, and participating in schooltesting. RESULTS: A questionnaire was completed by 64% (297/462) of participants.Students were generally not anxious at all (19.7%; 58/294) or not really anxious (40.0%; 114/295) about returning to school, although 5.4% (n = 16/295) wereextremely nervous. Most students were very worried about transmitting the virusto their family (60.2%; 177/294) rather than to other students (22.0%; 65/296) orschool staff (19.3%; 57/296), or catching the infection themselves (12.5%;37/296). Students were more likely to maintain physical distancing in thepresence of school staff (84.6%; 247/292) and in public places (79.5%; 233/293)but not when with other students (46.8%; 137/293) or friends (40.8%; 120/294). A greater proportion of younger students (school years 7-9; 11-14-year-olds)reported not being anxious at all than older students (school years 12-13;16-18-year-olds) (47/174 [27.0%] vs 3/63 [4.8%]; p = 0.001). Younger studentswere also less likely to adhere to physical distancing measures and wear facemasks. Most students reported positive experiences with SARS-CoV-2 testing inschools, with 92.3% (262/284) agreeing to have another blood test in futurevisits. CONCLUSIONS: Younger students in secondary schools were less concernedabout catching and transmitting SARS-CoV-2 and were less likely to adhere toprotective measures. Greater awareness of the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2transmission between secondary school students potentially leading to increasedrisk of infection in their teachers and their household members may increaseadherence to infection control measures within and outside schools.

We performed multivariate analysis to determine if age, race,comorbidity and regionality were predictors for mortality, ARDS, mechanicalventilation or sepsis hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 100,902hospitalized COVID-19 patients included in the analysis (median age 52 years, IQR36-67; 50.7% female), COVID-19 case fatality rate was 8.5% with majority ofdeaths in those >/= 65 years (70.8%). In multivariate analysis, age >/= 65 years,male gender and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were independent riskfactors for mortality and ARDS. Those identifying as non-Black or non-White race have a marginally higher risk for mortality (OR 1.101, CI 1.032-1.174) andgreater risk of ARDS (OR 1.44, CI 1.334-1.554) when compared to those whoidentify as White. The risk of mortality or ARDS was similar for Blacks asWhites. Multivariate analysis found higher mortality risk in the Northeast (OR1.299, CI 1.22-1.29) and West (OR 1.26, CI 1.18-1.34). Larger hospitals also had an increased risk of mortality, greatest in hospitals with 500-999 beds (OR 1.67,CI 1.43-1.95). CONCLUSION: Advanced age, male sex and a higher CCI predictedworse outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In multivariate analysis, worseoutcomes were identified in small minority populations, however there was nodifference in study outcomes between those who identify as Black or White.

AB  - Mammalian organs are individually controlled by autonomous circadian clocks. Atthe molecular level, this process is defined by the cyclical co-expression ofboth core transcription factors and their downstream targets across time. Whileinteractions between these molecular clocks are necessary for proper homeostasis,these features remain undefined. Here, we utilize integrative analysis of ababoon diurnal transcriptome atlas to characterize the properties of genenetworks under circadian control. We found that 53.4% (8120) of baboon genes are oscillating body-wide. Additionally, two basic network modes were observed at thesystems level: daytime and nighttime mode. Daytime networks were enriched forgenes involved in metabolism, while nighttime networks were enriched for genesassociated with growth and cellular signaling. A substantial number of diseasesonly form significant disease modules at either daytime or nighttime. Inaddition, a majority of SARS-CoV-2-related genes and modules are rhythmicallyexpressed, which have significant network proximities with circadian regulators. Our data suggest that synchronization amongst circadian gene networks isnecessary for proper homeostatic functions and circadian regulators have closeinteractions with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) andits current worldwide spread have caused a pandemic of acute respiratory disease COVID-19. The virus can result in mild to severe, and even to fatal respiratoryillness in humans, threatening human health and public safety. The spike (S)protein on the surface of viral membrane is responsible for viral entry into hostcells. The discovery of methods to inactivate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 throughdisruption of the S protein binding to its cognate receptor on the host cell isan active research area. To explore other prevention strategies against the quickspread of the virus and its mutants, non-equilibrium molecular dynamicssimulations have been employed to explore the possibility of manipulating thestructure-activity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by applying electricfields (EFs) in both the protein axial directions and in the directionperpendicular to the protein axis. We have found out the application of EFsperpendicular to the protein axis is most effective in denaturing the HR2 domain which plays critical role in viral-host membrane fusion. This finding suggeststhat varying irradiation angles may be an important consideration in developingEF based non-invasive technologies to inactivate the virus.

TI  - Vaccinia virus H7-protein is required for the organization of the viral scaffold protein into hexamers.
PG  - 13007
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16999-2 [doi]
AB  - Viruses of the giant virus family are characterized by a structurally conservedscaffold-capsid protein that shapes the icosahedral virion. The vaccinia virus(VACV) scaffold protein D13, however, transiently shapes the newly assembledviral membrane in to a sphere and is absent from the mature brick-shaped virion. In infected cells D13, a 62 kDa polypeptide, forms trimers that arrange inhexamers and a honey-comb like lattice. Membrane association of the D13-latticemay be mediated by A17, an abundant 21 kDa viral membrane protein. Whethermembrane binding mediates the formation of the honey-comb lattice or if otherfactors are involved, remains elusive. Here we show that H7, a 17 kDa proteinconserved among poxviruses, mediates proper formation of D13-hexamers, and hence the honey comb lattice and spherical immature virus. Without H7 synthesis D13trimers assemble into a large 3D network rather than the typical well organizedscaffold layer observed in wild-type infection, composed of short D13 tubes ofdiscrete length that are tightly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The data show an unexpected role for H7 in D13 organization and imply thatformation of the honey-comb, hexagonal, lattice is essential for VACV membraneassembly and production of infectious progeny. The data are discussed withrespect to scaffold proteins of other giant viruses.

AB  - Several universities around the world have resumed in-person teaching aftersuccessful vaccination campaigns have covered 70/80% of the population. In thisstudy, we combine a new compartmental model with an optimal control formulationto discover, among different non-pharmaceutical interventions, the bestprevention strategy to maximize on-campus activities while keeping spread undercontrol. Composed of two interconnectedSusceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered (SEIQR) structures, the model enables staff-to-staff infections, student-to-staff cross infections,student-to-student infections, and environment-to-individual infections. Then, wemodel input variables representing the implementation of differentnon-pharmaceutical interventions and formulate and solve optimal control problemsfor four desired scenarios: minimum number of cases, minimum intervention,minimum non-quarantine intervention, and minimum quarantine intervention. Ourresults reveal the particular significance of mask wearing and social distancing in universities with vaccinated population (with proportions according to UKdata). The study also reveals that quarantining infected students has a higherimportance than quarantining staff. In contrast, other measures such asenvironmental disinfection seems to be less important.

TI  - Microbiota succession throughout life from the cradle to the grave.
LID - 10.1038/s41579-022-00768-z [doi]
AB  - Associations between age and the human microbiota are robust and reproducible.The microbial composition at several body sites can predict human chronologicalage relatively accurately. Although it is largely unknown why specificmicroorganisms are more abundant at certain ages, human microbiota research haselucidated a series of microbial community transformations that occur betweenbirth and death. In this Review, we explore microbial succession in the healthyhuman microbiota from the cradle to the grave. We discuss the stages from primarysuccession at birth, to disruptions by disease or antibiotic use, to microbialexpansion at death. We address how these successions differ by body site and bydomain (bacteria, fungi or viruses). We also review experimental tools thatmicrobiota researchers use to conduct this work. Finally, we discuss futuredirections for studying the microbiota's relationship with age, includingdesigning consistent, well-powered, longitudinal studies, performing robuststatistical analyses and improving characterization of non-bacterialmicroorganisms.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 variants with adaptive mutations have continued to emerge, causingfresh waves of infection even amongst vaccinated population. The development ofbroad-spectrum antivirals is thus urgently needed. We previously developed twohetero-bivalent nanobodies (Nbs), aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with potentneutralization activity against the wild-type (WT) Wuhan isolated SARS-CoV-2, by fusing aRBD-2 with aRBD-5 and aRBD-7, respectively. Here, we resolved the crystalstructures of these Nbs in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, and found that aRBD-2 contacts with highly-conserved RBD residues and retains binding to the RBD of the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Delta plus,Kappa, Lambda, Omicron BA.1, and BA.2 variants. In contrast, aRBD-5 and aRBD-7bind to less-conserved RBD epitopes non-overlapping with the epitope of aRBD-2,and do not show apparent binding to the RBD of some variants. However, when fusedwith aRBD-2, they effectively enhance the overall binding affinity. Consistently,aRBD-2-5-Fc and aRBD-2-7-Fc potently neutralized all of the tested authentic orpseudotyped viruses, including WT, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1,BA.1.1 and BA.2. Furthermore, aRBD-2-5-Fc provided prophylactic protectionagainst the WT and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in mice, and conferred protectionagainst the Omicron BA.1 variant in hamsters prophylactically andtherapeutically, indicating that aRBD-2-5-Fc could potentially benefit theprevention and treatment of COVID-19 caused by the emerging variants of concern. Our strategy provides new solutions in the development of broad-spectrumtherapeutic antibodies for COVID-19.

AB  - Studying the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 informs on how the human immunesystem can respond to antigenic variants as well as other SARS-related viruses.Here, we structurally identified a YYDRxG motif encoded by IGHD3-22 in CDR H3that facilitates antibody targeting to a functionally conserved epitope on theSARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. A computational search for a YYDRxG patternin publicly available sequences uncovered 100 such antibodies, many of which can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV. Thus, the YYDRxG motif represents a common convergent solution for the human humoral immune system to targetsarbecoviruses including the Omicron variant. These findings suggest anepitope-targeting strategy to identify potent and broadly neutralizing antibodiesfor design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines and antibody therapeutics.

AB  - Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays are gold standard indiagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and play a major role in viral subtyping forrapid detection and monitoring of important mutations, containing the spread ofnew virus variants. We wanted to compare RT-qPCR melting curve analysis assays toSanger Sequencing for detection of variants within the SARS-CoV-2 spikeglycoprotein and examined their sensitivity and specificity. Samples positive forSARS-CoV-2 (n = 663 + 82) were subtyped using both Sanger sequencing and fiveRT-qPCR melting curve analysis assays specific for the mutations N501Y, P681H,E484K, K417N/T, and N439K. The results of the two methods were compared. Thetraining cohort and the clinical validation cohort showed equally, orsignificantly better sensitivity of the assays compared to the Sanger sequencing.The agreement of the Sanger sequencing and the assays ranged from 92.6 to 100%for the training cohort and 99.4-100% for the clinical validation. Thesensitivity, specificity, and turn-around time of the RT-qPCR melting curveanalysis assays are well-suited for clinical monitoring of VOCs, making theassays an important tool in contact tracing and risk stratification. Furthermore,the assays were able to indicate the presence of new mutations in thecomplementary sequence to the mutation-specific probes.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17318-5 [doi]
AB  - In the era of cervical cancer elimination, accurate and validated pipelines todetect human papillomavirus are essential to elucidate and understand HPVassociation with human cancers. We aimed to provide an open-source pipeline,"HPV-meta", to detect HPV transcripts in RNA sequencing data, including severalsteps to warn operators for possible viral contamination. The "HPV-meta" pipelineautomatically performs several steps, starting with quality trimming, humangenome filtering, HPV detection (blastx), cut-off settlement (10 reads and 690 bpcoverage to make an HPV call) and finishing with fasta sequence generation forHPV positive samples. Fasta sequences can then be aligned to assess sequencediversity among HPV positive samples. All RNA sequencing files (n = 10,908)present in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) were analyzed. "HPV-meta" identified 25different HPV types being present in 488/10,904 specimens. Validation of results showed 99.98% agreement (10,902/10,904). Multiple alignment from fasta fileswarned about high sequence identity between several HPV 18 and 38 positivesamples, whose contamination had previously been reported. The "HPV-meta"pipeline is a robust and validated pipeline that detects HPV in RNA sequencingdata. Obtaining the fasta files enables contamination investigation, a non veryrare occurrence in next generation sequencing.

TI  - Knockdown of Piccolo in the Nucleus Accumbens Suppresses Methamphetamine-Induced Hyperlocomotion and Conditioned Place Preference in Mice.
LID - 10.1007/s11064-022-03680-3 [doi]
AB  - Methamphetamine (METH), the most widely distributed psychostimulant, aberrantlyactivates the reward system in the brain to induce addictive behaviors. Thepresynaptic protein "Piccolo", encoded by Pclo, was identified as aMETH-responsive protein with enhanced expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)in mice. Although the physiological and pathological significance of Piccolo has been identified in dopaminergic signaling, its role in METH-induced behavioralabnormalities and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To clarify suchfunctions, mice with Piccolo knockdown in the NAc (NAc-miPiccolo mice) by localinjection of an adeno-associated virus vector carrying miRNA targeting Pclo were generated and investigated. NAc-miPiccolo mice exhibited suppressedhyperlocomotion, sensitization, and conditioned place preference behavior inducedby systemic administration of METH. The excessive release of dopamine in the NAc was reduced in NAc-miPiccolo mice at baseline and in response to METH. Theseresults suggest that Piccolo in the NAc is involved in METH-induced behavioralalterations and is a candidate therapeutic target for the treatment of drugaddiction.

AB  - Avian influenza viruses can pose serious risks to agricultural production, human health, and wildlife. An understanding of viruses in wild reservoir speciesacross time and space is important to informing surveillance programs, riskmodels, and potential population impacts for vulnerable species. Although it isrecognized that influenza A virus prevalence peaks in reservoir waterfowl in latesummer through autumn, temporal and spatial variation across species has not beenfully characterized. We combined two large influenza databases for North America and applied spatiotemporal models to explore patterns in prevalence throughoutthe annual cycle and across the continental United States for 30 waterfowlspecies. Peaks in prevalence in late summer through autumn were pronounced fordabbling ducks in the genera Anas and Spatula, but not Mareca. Spatially, areasof high prevalence appeared to be related to regional duck density, with highest predicted prevalence found across the upper Midwest during early fall, thoughfurther study is needed. We documented elevated prevalence in late winter andearly spring, particularly in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Our resultssuggest that spatiotemporal variation in prevalence outside autumn staging areas may also represent a dynamic parameter to be considered in IAV ecology andassociated risks.

AB  - Strong biofilm-forming Enterococcus feacalis urinary tract pathogens (n = 35)were used to determine the lytic spectrum of six bacteriophages isolated fromsewage samples. Only 17 Enterococcus feacalis isolates gave lytic zones with the tested bacteriophages from which five isolates were susceptible to all of them.The isolated enterococcal phages are characterized by wide range of thermal(30-90 degrees C) and pH (3-10) stability. They belong to order Caudovirales,from which four bacteriophages (EPA, EPB, EPD, EPF) belong to family Myoviridaeand two (EPC, EPE) belong to family Siphoviridae. In addition, they havepromising antibiofilm activity against the tested strong-forming biofilm E.faecalis isolates. The enterococcal phages reduced the formed and preformedbiofilms to a range of 38.02-45.7% and 71.0-80.0%, respectively, as compared tothe control. The same promising activities were obtained on studying theanti-adherent effect of the tested bacteriophages on the adherence of bacterialcells to the surface of urinary catheter segments. They reduced the number ofadherent cells to a range of 30.8-43.8% and eradicated the pre-adherent cells to a range of 48.2-71.1%, as compared to the control. Overall, the obtainedpromising antibiofilm activity makes these phages good candidates for applicationin preventing and treating biofilm associated Enterococcus faecalis infections.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16489-5 [doi]
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted with 144 small-scale poultry farmers across42 Bangladeshi villages to explore risk factors associated with avian influenzaH5 and H9 seropositivity on backyard chicken farms. Using mixed-effects logistic regression with village as random effect, we identified crow abundance in garbagedumping places and presence of migratory wild birds within villages to beassociated with higher odds of H5 and H9 seropositivity. At farm-level, garbagearound poultry houses was also associated with higher odds of H5 and H9seropositivity. In addition, specific trading practices (such as, purchase ofchickens from live bird markets (LBM) and neighboring farms to raise them ontheir own farms, frequency of visits to LBM, purchase of poultry at LBM forconsumption) and contact of backyard chickens with other animals (such as,feeding of different poultry species together, using pond water as drinkingsource for poultry, access of feral and wild animals to poultry houses) wereassociated with higher odds of H5 or H9 seropositivity. Resource-constrainedsmall-scale poultry farmers should be able to address risk factors identified in this study without requiring large investments into poultry management, therebyreducing the likelihood of avian influenza virus transmission and ultimatelyoccurrence of avian influenza outbreaks.

PG  - 13001
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16795-y [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophages offer a sustainable alternative for controlling crop disease.However, the lack of knowledge on phage infection mechanisms makes phage-basedbiological control varying and ineffective. In this work, we interrogated thetemperature dependence of the infection and thermo-responsive behavior of the C22phage. This soilborne podovirus is capable of lysing Ralstonia solanacearum,causing bacterial wilt disease. We revealed that the C22 phage could betterinfect the pathogenic host cell when incubated at low temperatures (25, 30degrees C) than at high temperatures (35, 40 degrees C). Measurement of the C22phage stiffness revealed that the phage stiffness at low temperatures was 2-3times larger than at high temperatures. In addition, the imaging results showedthat more C22 phage particles were attached to the cell surface at lowtemperatures than at high temperatures, associating the phage stiffness and thephage attachment. The result suggests that the structure and stiffness modulationin response to temperature change improve infection, providing mechanisticinsight into the C22 phage lytic cycle. Our study signifies the need tounderstand phage responses to the fluctuating environment for effectivephage-based biocontrol implementation.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causativeagent of the COVID-19 global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus that relies on its trimeric surface glycoprotein spike for entry into host cells. Herewe describe the COVID-19 vaccine candidate MV-014-212, a live, attenuated,recombinant human respiratory syncytial virus expressing a chimeric SARS-CoV-2spike as the only viral envelope protein. MV-014-212 was attenuated andimmunogenic in African green monkeys (AGMs). One mucosal administration ofMV-014-212 in AGMs protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, reducing by more than 200-fold the peak shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the nose. MV-014-212 elicited mucosalimmunoglobulin A in the nose and neutralizing antibodies in serum that exhibited cross-neutralization against virus variants of concern Alpha, Beta, and Delta.Intranasally delivered, live attenuated vaccines such as MV-014-212 entaillow-cost manufacturing suitable for global deployment. MV-014-212 is currently inPhase 1 clinical trials as an intranasal COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) have triggered infection waves. Oralantivirals such as molnupiravir promise to improve disease management, butefficacy against VOC delta was questioned and potency against omicron is unknown.This study evaluates molnupiravir against VOC in human airway epitheliumorganoids, ferrets, and a lethal Roborovski dwarf hamster model of severeCOVID-19-like lung injury. VOC were equally inhibited by molnupiravir in cellsand organoids. Treatment reduced shedding in ferrets and prevented transmission. Pathogenicity in dwarf hamsters was VOC-dependent and highest for delta, gamma,and omicron. All molnupiravir-treated dwarf hamsters survived, showing reduction in lung virus load from one (delta) to four (gamma) orders of magnitude.Treatment effect size varied in individual dwarf hamsters infected with omicronand was significant in males, but not females. The dwarf hamster modelrecapitulates mixed efficacy of molnupiravir in human trials and alerts thatbenefit must be reassessed in vivo as VOC evolve.

AB  - Highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants have continuously emerged and spread around the world, and updated vaccines and innovative vaccination strategies areurgently needed to address the global SARS-COV2 pandemic. Here, we established a series of Ad5-vectored SARS-CoV-2 variant vaccines encoding multiple spikeproteins derived from the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Delta and Omicronlineages and analyzed the antibody immune responses induced by single-dose andprime-boost vaccination strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants ofconcern (VOCs). Single-dose vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 variant vaccines tendedto elicit the optimal self-matched neutralizing effects, and Ad5-B.1.351 producedmore broad-spectrum cross-neutralizing antibodies against diverse variants. Incontrast, prime-boost vaccination further strengthened and broadened theneutralizing antibody responses against highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Theheterologous administration of Ad5-B.1.617.2 and Ad5-B.1.429 to Ad5-WT-primedmice resulted in superior antibody responses against most VOCs. In particular,the Omicron spike could only stimulate self-matched neutralizing antibodies with infrequent cross-reactivities to other variants used in single-dose vaccinationstrategies; moreover, with prime-boost regimens, this vaccine elicited an optimalspecific neutralizing antibody response to Omicron, and prompted cross-antibodyresponses against other VOCs that were very similar to those obtained with Ad5-WTbooster. Overall, this study delineated the unique characteristics of antibodyresponses to the SARS-CoV-2 VOC spikes with the single-dose or prime-boostvaccination strategies and provided insight into the vaccine development of next SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

TI  - Genomic Annotation and Molecular Evolution of Monkeypox Virus Outbreak in 2022.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28036 [doi]
AB  - Monkeypox virus (MPXV) has generally circulated in West and Central Africa since its emergence. Recently, sporadic MPXV infections in several non-endemiccountries have attracted widespread attention. Here, we conducted a systematicanalysis of the recent outbreak of MPXV-2022, including its genomic annotationand molecular evolution. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the MPXV-2022strains belong to the same lineage of the MPXV strain isolated in 2018. However, compared with the MPXV strain in 2018, in total 46 new consensus mutations wereobserved in the MPXV-2022 strains, including 24 non-synonymous mutations. Byassigning mutations to 187 proteins encoded by the MPXV genome, we found that tenproteins in the monkeypox virus are more prone to mutation, including D2L-like,OPG023, OPG047, OPG071, OPG105, OPG109, A27L-like, OPG153, OPG188, and OPG210proteins. In the MPXV-2022 strains, 4 and 3 nucleotide substitutions are observedin OPG105 and OPG210, respectively. Overall, our studies illustrated the genomeevolution of the ongoing MPXV outbreak and pointed out novel mutations as areference for further studies. This article is protected by copyright.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2021, Delta became the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant worldwide.While vaccines have effectively prevented COVID-19 hospitalization and death,vaccine breakthrough infections increasingly occurred. The precise role ofclinical and genomic determinants in Delta infections is not known, and whetherthey contributed to increased rates of breakthrough infections compared tounvaccinated controls. METHODS: We studied SARS-CoV-2 variant distribution,dynamics, and adaptive selection over time in relation to vaccine status,phylogenetic relatedness of viruses, full genome mutation profiles, andassociated clinical and demographic parameters. FINDINGS: We show a steep andnear-complete replacement of circulating variants with Delta between May andAugust 2021 in metropolitan New York. We observed an increase of the Deltasublineage AY.25 (14% in vaccinated, 7% in unvaccinated), its spike mutationS112L, and AY.44 (8% in vaccinated, 2% in unvaccinated) with its nsp12 mutationF192V in breakthroughs. Delta infections were associated with younger age andlower hospitalization rates than Alpha. Delta breakthrough infections increasedsignificantly with time since vaccination, and, after adjusting for confounders, they rose at similar rates as in unvaccinated individuals. INTERPRETATION: Weobserved a modest adaptation of Delta genomes in breakthrough infections in NewYork, suggesting an improved genomic framework to support Delta's epidemic growthin times of waning vaccine protection despite limited impact on vaccine escape.FUNDING: The study was supported by NYU institutional funds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A serum-free, highly purified Vero rabies vaccine (PVRV-NG) has been developed with no animal or human components and low residual DNA content. AphaseII randomized clinical study aimed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of theimmune response and assess the safety profile of PVRV-NG versus a licensed human diploid cell culture rabies vaccine (HDCV) in a pre-exposure regimen in healthychildren and adolescents in the Philippines. METHODOLOGY: Children aged 2-11years and adolescents aged 12-17 years were randomized (2:1) to receive threeinjections of either PVRV-NG or HDCV (on day [D] 0, D7 and D28). Rabiesvirus-neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) were measured at D0, D42 and 6 months after the first injection (month [M] 6). Safety was assessed during the vaccinationperiod and up to 28 days after the last vaccination. Serious adverse events were followed until 6 months after last vaccination. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 342 healthyparticipants (171 children and 171 adolescents) were randomized and followed for 6 months after the last dose. All participants in both groups had an RVNA titer>/= 0.5 IU/ml at D42, demonstrating non-inferiority in seroconversion rate forPVRV-NG versus HDCV. Over 90% of participants had RVNA titer >/= 0.5 IU/ml at M6.PVRV-NG was well tolerated after each vaccination and up to 6 months followingthe last dose. There were no major safety concerns during the study, and the typeand severity of solicited adverse events was similar for both treatment groups.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the non-inferior immune profile of PVRV-NGcompared with HDCV in a pre-exposure setting within a pediatric population.PVRV-NG was well tolerated with no safety concerns. This study is registered atClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01930357) and EU Clinical Trials Register(2015-003203-30).

AB  - We and other researchers have shown that companion animals (pet cats and dogs)are susceptible to natural SARS-CoV-2 infections. A recent report(1) indicatesthat pet cat can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to human via direct contact raises alegitimate concern that infected pets can pass the virus on to their human pet's owners. In this letter, we reviewed known cases of animal-to-human transmissions as well as human-to-animal transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 and assess the levels ofrisks in these scenarios.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has provided a set of uniquechallenges for paediatric patients requiring emergency care across the globe.Reduction in paediatric emergency department (ED) usage during the COVID-19pandemic has been widely reported, but no studies to date have consolidated anddescribed what ramifications these reductions may have on neonatal and infanthealth. This scoping review aims to characterise the impact of the COVID-19pandemic on infant ED visits and neonatal and infant health. METHODS ANDANALYSIS: A comprehensive literature search will be conducted from March 2020 to July 2022 using the following databases: Embase (Ovid), Web of Science (ClarivateAnalytics), Medline (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCOhost). This scoping review will use afive-step framework to guide the selection, extraction and analysis of data from eligible studies, with an additional sixth step for clinical consultation.Studies in English reporting the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on infant EDvisits, as well as neonatal and infant health, will be included for screening.Key findings will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items forSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. ETHICS ANDDISSEMINATION: Research ethics board approval will not be required due to thenature of the study design. The results of this scoping review will bedisseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presentation atacademic conferences.

AB  - Alphaviruses, such as Sindbis virus and Chikungunya virus, are RNA viruses with apositive sense single-stranded RNA genome that infect various vertebratesincluding humans. A conserved sequence element (CSE) of ~19 nucleotides (nts) in the 3' non-coding region is important for replication. Despite extensivemutational analysis of the CSE no comprehensive model of this element exists todate. Here it is shown that the CSE can form an RNA pseudoknot with part of thepolyA tail and is similar to the human telomerase peudoknot with which it shares 17 nts. Mutants that alter the stability of the pseudoknot were investigated inthe context of a replicon of Sindbis virus and by native gel electrophoresis.These studies reveal that the pseudoknot is required for virus replication and isstabilized by UAU base triples. The new model is discussed in relation toprevious data on Sindbis virus mutants and revertants lacking (part of) the CSE.

AB  - Water commuting is a major urban transportation method in Thailand. However,urban boat commuters risk exposure to microbially contaminated bioaerosols orsplash. We aimed to investigate the microbial community structures, identifybacterial and viral pathogens, and assess the abundance of antimicrobialresistance genes (ARGs) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) at 10 samplingsites along an 18km transportation boat route in the Saen Saep Canal, whichtraverses cultural, commercial, and suburban land-based zones. The shotgunmetagenomic (Illumina HiSeq) and 16s rRNA gene amplicon (V4 region) (IlluminaMiSeq) sequencing platforms revealed diverse microbial clusters aligned with the zones, with explicit segregation between the cultural and suburban sites. Theshotgun metagenomic sequencing further identified bacterial and viral pathogens, and ARGs. The predominant bacterial pathogens (>0.5% relative abundance) were theBurkholderia cepacia complex, Arcobacter butzleri, Burkholderia vietnamiensis,Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the Enterobacter cloacae complex. The viruses(0.28%-0.67% abundance in all microbial sequences) comprised mainly vertebrateviruses and bacteriophages, with encephalomyocarditis virus (33.3%-58.2%abundance in viral sequences), hepatitis C virus genotype 1, humanalphaherpesvirus 1, and human betaherpesvirus 6A among the human viral pathogens.The 15 ARG types contained 611 ARG subtypes, including those resistant tobeta-lactam, which was the most diverse and abundant group (206 subtypes;17.0%-27.5%), aminoglycoside (94 subtypes; 9.6%-15.3%), tetracycline (80subtypes; 15.6%-20.2%), and macrolide (79 subtypes; 14.5%-32.1%). Interestingly, the abundance of ARGs associated with resistance to beta-lactam, trimethoprim,and sulphonamide, as well as A. butzleri and crAssphage, at the cultural siteswas significantly different from the other sites (p<0.05). We demonstrated thebenefits of using NGS to deliver insights into microbial communities, andantimicrobial resistance, both of which pose a risk to human health. Using NGSmayfacilitate microbial risk mitigation and management for urban water commuters andproximal residents.

AB  - Interruption of the activity of neurons in the commissural portion of the nucleusof the solitary tract (cNTS) decreases blood pressure (BP) in experimental modelsof hypertension, such as the spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rat. To examinewhether PHOX2B expressing cNTS neurons are involved in maintaining the elevatedBP, we used replication-deficient viruses with a modified Phox2 binding sitepromoter to express the inhibitory chemogenetic allatostatin receptor or greenfluorescent protein in the cNTS. Following administration of allatostatin, weobserved a depressor and bradycardic response in anesthetized SH rats thatexpressed the allatostatin receptor. Injection of allatostatin did not affect BP or heart rate (HR) in control SH rats expressing green fluorescent protein in thecNTS. Immunohistochemistry showed that the majority of transduced cNTS neuronswere PHOX2B-immunoreactive and some also expressed tyrosine hydroxylase. Weconclude that in anesthetized SH rat, the Phox2B expressing cNTS neurons maintainelevated BP.

AB  - Intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) accelerates atherosclerosis progression. To scavengeexcessive red blood cells (RBCs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) with greatplasticity may function as phagocytes. Here, we investigated theerythrophagocytosis function of VSMCs and possible regulations involved. Based ontranscriptional microarray analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomespathway enrichment analysis showed that genes up-regulated in human carotidatheroma with IPH were enriched in functions of phagocytic activities, whilethose down-regulated were enriched in VSMCs contraction function. Transcriptionalexpression of Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) was alsodown-regulated in atheroma with IPH. In high-fat diet-fed apolipoproteinE-deficient mice, erythrocytes were present in cells expressing VSMC markersalphaSMA in the brachiocephalic artery, suggesting VSMCs play a role inerythrophagocytosis. Using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, we also foundthat eryptotic RBCs were bound to and internalized by VSMCs in aphosphatidylserine/MFG-E8/integrin alphaVbeta3 dependent manner in vitro.Inhibiting S1PR2 signaling with specific inhibitor JTE-013 or siRNA decreasedMfge8 expression and impaired the erythrophagocytosis of VSMCs in vitro. Partial ligation was performed in the left common carotid artery (LCA) followed byintra-intimal injection of isolated erythrocytes to observe their clearance invivo. Interfering S1PR2 expression in VSMCs with Adeno-associated virus 9inhibited MFG-E8 expression inside LCA plaques receiving RBCs injection andattenuated erythrocytes clearance. Erythrophagocytosis by VSMCs increasedvascular endothelial growth factor-a secretion and promoted angiogenesis. Thepresent study revealed that VSMCs act as phagocytes for RBC clearance throughS1PR2 activation induced MFG-E8 release.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, whichstarted from China. It spread rapidly throughout the world and was later declareda pandemic by the WHO. Over the course of time, SARS-CoV-2 has mutated forsurvival advantages, and this led to multiple variants. Multiple studies onmutations identification in SARS-CoV2 have been published covering extensivesample areas. The purpose of this study was to limit the sample area to theGeorgia state in the U.S. and to analyze the genome sequences for mutationprofiling across the genome and origin of variants. METHODS: The genome sequences(n=3,970) were obtained from the NCBI database as of June 12, 2021, with thefilter of being complete sequenced genomes, homo-sapiens host, and only fromGeorgia State of the U.S. NextClade, an online tool was used for the analysis of the sequences using Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 as a reference genome. The algorithm wassequence alignment, translation, mutation calling, phylogenetic placement, clade assignment, and quality control (QC). Thirty-six samples with bad QC were removedfrom the mutational analysis. RESULTS: A total 117,743 mutations in thenucleotides were identified (averaging 31.5 mutations per sample). The mutations A23403G, C3037T, C241T, and C14408T were detected in 98% of the samples. Also, a total of 75,517 mutations in the amino acid were identified (averaging 20.2mutations per sample). The mutations D614G and P314L were identified in >97%samples whereas R203K, G204R, P681H, and N501Y were detected in >50% samples.Analysis also revealed 16 different clades with 20I (49.6%). Clades 20G (24.2%)and 20A (5.5%) being the most abundant, showed that SARS-CoV-2 in the GeorgiaState originated mainly from Southeast England, other parts of the U.S., andseveral countries in Western Europe. CONCLUSION: Looking at the three most commonvariants in Georgia State of the U.S., we could determine the primary locationsof transmission or origin for the virus, and our analyses indicates that majorityof the cases originated from Southeast England (Clade 20I), the U.S. itself(Clade 20G), and from Western Europe (Clade 20C).
