AB  - The effects of crude oil spills are an ongoing problem for wildlife and human
      health in both marine and freshwater aquatic environments. Bioassays of model
      organisms are a convenient way to assess the potential risks of the substances
      involved in oil spills. Zebrafish embryos (ZFE) are a useful to reach a fast and 
      detailed description of the toxicity of the pollutants, including both the
      components of the crude oil itself and substances that are commonly used for
      crude oil spill mitigation (e.g. surfactants). Here, we evaluated the survival
      rate, as well as histological, morphological, and proteomic changes in ZFE
      exposed to Water Accumulated Fraction (WAF) of light crude oil and in mixture
      with Dioctyl Sulfosuccinate Sodium (DOSS, e.g. CEWAF: Chemically Enhanced WAF), a
      surfactant that is frequently used in chemical dispersant formulations.
      Furthermore, we compared the hydrocarbon concentration of WAF and CEWAF of the
      sublethal dilution. In histological, morphological, and gene expression
      variables, the ZFE exposed to WAF showed less changes than those exposed to
      CEWAF. Proteomic changes were more dramatic in ZFE exposed to WAF, with important
      alterations in spliceosomal and ribosomal proteins, as well as proteins related
      to eye and retinal photoreceptor development and heart function. We also found
      that the concentration of high molecular weight hydrocarbons in water was slighly
      higher in presence of DOSS, but the low molecular weight hydrocarbons
      concentration was higher in WAF. These results provide an important starting
      point for identifying useful crude-oil exposure biomarkers in fish species.

AB  - Eukaryotic DNA exist in the nuclei in the form of a complex with proteins called 
      chromatin. Access to the information encoded in the DNA requires the opening of
      the chromatin. Modulation of the chromatin structure is therefore an important
      layer of regulation for DNA-templated processes. The basic unit of the chromatin 
      is the nucleosome, which contains DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones, H2A,
      H2B, H3, and H4. Because histones are a structural part of the nucleosome, its
      modification can lead to changes in chromatin structure. Amino acid residues in
      histones could be modified with at least 20 different types of functional groups 
      leading to a vast number of modified residues. Here, an overview of the histone
      modifications found in plants is provided. We focus mainly in proteomic-based
      studies either aimed to identify PTMs on purified histones or proteome-wide
      analysis of particular modifications. The strategies used for cataloging
      modifications in plants are also described. Profiling of histone modifications is
      important to begin to understand their functions as mediators of gene regulation 
      in plant biological systems.

AB  - We report the first proteomics analyses of the venoms of two poorly studied
      snakes, the Manabi hognosed pitviper Porthidium arcosae endemic to the western
      coastal province of Manabi (Ecuador), and the Costa Rican hognosed pitviper P.
      volcanicum with distribution restricted to South Pacific Costa Rica and western
      Panama. These venom proteomes share a conserved compositional pattern reported in
      four other congeneric species within the clade of South American Porthidium
      species, P. nasutum, P. lansbergii, P. ophryomegas, and P. porrasi. The
      paraspecific immunorecognition profile of antivenoms produced in Costa Rica (ICP 
      polyvalent), Peru (Instituto Nacional de Salud) and Brazil (soro antibotropico
      pentavalente, SAB, from Instituto Butantan) against the venom of P. arcosae was
      investigated through a third-generation antivenomics approach. The maximal
      venom-binding capacities of the investigated antivenoms were 97.1 mg, 21.8 mg,
      and 25.7 mg of P. arcosae venom proteins per gram of SAB, ICP, and INS-PERU
      antibody molecules, respectively, which translate into 28.4 mg, 13.1 mg, and 15.2
      mg of total venom proteins bound per vial of SAB, ICP, and INS-PERU AV. The
      antivenomics results suggest that 21.8%, 7.8% and 6.1% of the SAB, ICP, and
      INS-PERU antibody molecules recognized P. arcosae venom toxins. The SAB antivenom
      neutralized P. arcosae venom's lethality in mice with an ED50 of 31.3 mgV/g SAB
      AV. This preclinical neutralization paraspecificity points to Brazilian SAB as a 
      promising candidate for the treatment of envenomings by Ecuadorian P. arcosae.
      BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Assessing the preclinical efficacy profile of antivenoms
      against homologous and heterologous medically relevant snake venoms represents an
      important goal towards defining the biogeographic range of their clinical
      utility. This is particularly relevant in regions, such as Mesoamerica, where a
      small number of pharmaceutical companies produce antivenoms against the venoms of
      a small number of species of maximum medical relevance among the local rich
      herpetofauna, leaving a wide range of snakes of secondary medical relevance, but 
      also causing life-threatening human envenomings without nominal clinical
      coverage. This work is part of a larger project aiming at mapping the
      immunological characteristics of antivenoms generated in Latin American countries
      towards venoms of such poorly studied snakes of the local and neighboring
      countries' herpetofauna. Here we report the proteomics characterization of the
      Manabi hognosed pitviper Porthidium arcosae endemic to the western coastal
      province of Manabi (Ecuador), and the Costa Rican hognosed pitviper P. volcanicum
      with distribution restricted to southwestern Costa Rica, the antivenomics
      assessment of three bothropoid commercial antivenoms produced in Costa Rica,
      Peru, and Brazil against the venom components of P. arcosae, and the in vivo
      capacity of the Brazilian soro antibotropico pentavalente (SAB) from Instituto
      Butantan to neutralize the murine lethality of P. arcosae venom. The preclinical 
      paraspecific ED50 of 31.3 mg of P. arcosae venom per gram of antivenom points to 
      Brazilian SAB as a promising candidate for the treatment of envenomings by the
      Manabi hognosed pitviper P. arcosae.

TI  - Nutrition and Rheumatoid Arthritis in the 'Omics' Era.
LID - 763 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu13030763 [doi]
AB  - Modern high-throughput 'omics' science tools (including genomics,
      transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiomics) are currently being
      applied to nutritional sciences to unravel the fundamental processes of health
      effects ascribed to particular nutrients in humans and to contribute to more
      precise nutritional advice. Diet and food components are key environmental
      factors that interact with the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and
      the microbiota, and this life-long interplay defines health and diseases state of
      the individual. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease
      featured by a systemic immune-inflammatory response, in genetically susceptible
      individuals exposed to environmental triggers, including diet. In recent years
      increasing evidences suggested that nutritional factors and gut microbiome have a
      central role in RA risk and progression. The aim of this review is to summarize
      the main and most recent applications of 'omics' technologies in human nutrition 
      and in RA research, examining the possible influences of some nutrients and
      nutritional patterns on RA pathogenesis, following a nutrigenomics approach. The 
      opportunities and challenges of novel 'omics technologies' in the exploration of 
      new avenues in RA and nutritional research to prevent and manage RA will be also 
      discussed.

AB  - Bartonella bacilliformis a gram-negative facultative aerobe responsible for the
      Carrion's disease widely distributed in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia with a high
      mortality rate when no specific treatment is received. B bacilliformis is
      transmitted by Sand fly (Lutzomyia verrucarum) to healthy individuals.
      Immunoinformatic and subtractive proteomics approaches were employed in this
      study to prioritize the best candidates for vaccine designing. These approaches
      resulted in five vaccine candidates, flagellar biosynthetic protein (Uniprot ID: 
      A1UTU1), heme exporter protein C (UniProt ID: A1UU82), Cytochrome c-type
      biogenesis protein (Uniprot ID: A1URZ7), Hemin ABC transporter (Uniprot ID:
      A1US20) and Phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase (Uniprot ID: A1USE3). The
      mentioned proteins are antigenic and essential for pathogen survival. A range of 
      immune-informatics tools was applied for the prediction of B and T cell epitopes 
      for the vaccine candidate proteins. In-silico vaccine was constructed using
      carefully evaluated epitopes and consequently modeled for docking with human
      Toll-like receptor 4. TLR-4 agonist 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 (UniproKB ID;
      P9WHE3) was linked to the vaccine as an adjuvant to boost immune response towards
      the vaccine. For stability evaluation of the vaccine-TLR-4 docked complex, MD
      simulations were performed. The final vaccine was back-translated and cloned in
      Eschericia coli to attain the maximal expression of the vaccine protein. The
      maximal expression was ensured, and the CAI score of 0.96 was reported. The
      current vaccine requires future experimental validation to confirm its
      effectiveness. The vaccine developed will be helpful to protect against B
      bacilliformis associated infections.

AB  - Communication between individuals via molecules, termed chemosignaling, is
      widespread among animal and plant species. However, we lack knowledge on the
      specific functions of the substances involved for most systems. The femoral gland
      is an organ that secretes a waxy substance involved in chemical communication in 
      lizards. Although the lipids and volatile substances secreted by the femoral
      glands have been investigated in several biochemical studies, the protein
      composition and functions of secretions remain completely unknown. Applying a
      proteomic approach, we provide the first attempt to comprehensively characterize 
      the protein composition of femoral gland secretions from the Galapagos marine
      iguana. Using samples from several organs, the marine iguana proteome was
      assembled by next-generation sequencing and MS, resulting in 7513 proteins. Of
      these, 4305 proteins were present in the femoral gland, including keratins, small
      serum proteins, and fatty acid-binding proteins. Surprisingly, no proteins with
      discernible roles in partner recognition or inter-species communication could be 
      identified. However, we did find several proteins with direct associations to the
      innate immune system, including lysozyme C, antileukoproteinase (ALP), pulmonary 
      surfactant protein (SFTPD), and galectin (LGALS1) suggesting that the femoral
      glands function as an important barrier to infection. Furthermore, we report
      several novel anti-microbial peptides from the femoral glands that show similar
      action against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis such as oncocin, a peptide 
      known for its effectiveness against Gram-negative pathogens. This proteomics data
      set is a valuable resource for future functional protein analysis and
      demonstrates that femoral gland secretions also perform functions of the innate
      immune system.

AB  - Dimethyl labeling is a type of stable-isotope labeling suitable for creating
      isotopic variants of peptides and thus be utilized for quantitative proteomics
      experiments. Labeling is achieved through a reductive amination/alkylation
      reaction using the low-cost reagents formaldehyde and cyanoborohydride, resulting
      in dimethylation of free amine groups of Lys and N-termini. Availability of
      isotopomeric forms of these reagents allows for the generation of up to six
      different isotopic variants. Here we describe the application of dimethylation to
      create two isotopic variants, light and heavy, differing in 4 Da, to label the
      total tryptic digest peptides of cocoa pod extracted from healthy pods from
      cultivars susceptible and resistant to the fungal disease called "frosty pod"
      caused by Moniliophthora roreri.

AB  - Toxocariasis, a natural helminth infection of dogs and cats caused by Toxocara
      canis and T. cati, respectively, that are transmitted to mammals, including
      humans. Infection control is based currently on periodic antihelmintic treatment 
      and there is a need for the development of vaccines to prevent this infection.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight potential vaccine candidate T. canis recombinant
      proteins were identified by in silico (rTcGPRs, rTcCad, rTcVcan, rTcCyst) and
      larval proteomics (rTES26, rTES32, rMUC-3 and rCTL-4) analyses. Immunogenicity
      and protection against infectious challenge for seven of these antigens were
      determined in a murine model of toxocariasis. C57BL/6 female mice were immunized 
      with each of or combinations of recombinant antigens prior to challenge with 500 
      T. canis embryonated eggs. Levels of specific antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and
      IgE) in sera and cytokines (IL-5, INF- and IL-10) produced by antigens-stimulated
      splenocytes, were measured. Presence of specific antibodies to the molecules was 
      measured in sera of T. canis-seropositive dogs and humans. RESULTS: All seven
      molecules were immunogenic in immunized mice; all stimulated significantly
      elevated levels of specific IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a and six were associated with
      elevated levels of specific IgE; all induced elevated production of IFN- and
      IL-10 by splenocytes, but only the in silico-identified membrane-associated
      recombinants (rTcCad, rTcVcan, and rTcCyst) induced significantly increased IL-5 
      production. Vaccination with two of the latter (rTcCad and rTcVcan) reduced
      larval loads in the T. canis challenged mice by 54.3% and 53.9% (P < 0.0001),
      respectively, compared to unimmunized controls. All seven recombinants were
      recognized by T. canis-seropositive dog and human sera. CONCLUSION: The
      identification of vaccine targets by in silico analysis was an effective strategy
      to identify immunogenic T. canis proteins capable of reducing larval burdens
      following challenge with the parasite. Two recombinant proteins, rTcCad and
      rTcVcan, were identified as promising vaccine candidates for canine toxocariasis.

TI  - Venomics and antivenomics of the poorly studied Brazil's lancehead, Bothrops
      brazili (Hoge, 1954), from the Brazilian State of Para.
PG  - e20190103
LID - 10.1590/1678-9199-JVATITD-2019-0103 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Brazil's lancehead, Bothrops brazili, is a poorly studied pit
      viper distributed in lowlands of the equatorial rainforests of southern Colombia,
      northeastern Peru, eastern Ecuador, southern and southeastern Venezuela, Guyana, 
      Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, and northern Bolivia. Few studies have been
      reported on toxins isolated from venom of Ecuadorian and Brazilian B. brazili.
      The aim of the present study was to elucidate the qualitative and quantitative
      protein composition of B. brazili venom from Para (Brazil), and to carry out a
      comparative antivenomics assessment of the immunoreactivity of the Brazilian
      antibothropic pentavalent antivenom [soro antibotropico (SAB) in Portuguese]
      against the venoms of B. brazili and reference species, B. jararaca. METHODS: We 
      have applied a quantitative snake venomics approach, including reverse-phase and 
      two-dimensional electrophoretic decomplexation of the venom toxin arsenal,
      LC-ESI-MS mass profiling and peptide-centric MS/MS proteomic analysis, to unveil 
      the overall protein composition of B. brazili venom from Para (Brazil). Using
      third-generation antivenomics, the specific and paraspecific immunoreactivity of 
      the Brazilian SAB against homologous (B. jararaca) and heterologous (B. brazili) 
      venoms was investigated. RESULTS: The venom proteome of the Brazil's lancehead
      (Para) is predominantly composed of two major and three minor acidic (19%) and
      two major and five minor basic (14%) phospholipase A2 molecules; 7-11 snake venom
      metalloproteinases of classes PI (21%) and PIII (6%); 10-12 serine proteinases
      (14%), and 1-2 L-amino acid oxidases (6%). Other toxins, including two
      cysteine-rich secretory proteins, one C-type lectin-like molecule, one nerve
      growth factor, one 5'-nucleotidase, one phosphodiesterase, one phospholipase B,
      and one glutaminyl cyclase molecule, represent together less than 2.7% of the
      venom proteome. Third generation antivenomics profile of the Brazilian
      pentabothropic antivenom showed paraspecific immunoreactivity against all the
      toxin classes of B. brazili venom, with maximal binding capacity of 132.2 mg
      venom/g antivenom. This figure indicates that 19% of antivenom's F(ab')2
      antibodies bind B. brazili venom toxins. CONCLUSION: The proteomics outcome
      contribute to a deeper insight into the spectrum of toxins present in the venom
      of the Brazil's lancehead, and rationalize the pathophysiology underlying this
      snake bite envenomings. The comparative qualitative and quantitative
      immunorecognition profile of the Brazilian pentabothropic antivenom toward the
      venom toxins of B. brazili and B. jararaca (the reference venom for assessing the
      bothropic antivenom's potency in Brazil), provides clues about the proper use of 
      the Brazilian antibothropic polyvalent antivenom in the treatment of bites by the
      Brazil's lancehead.

AB  - Venoms of the viperid genus Bothrocophias, restricted to Colombia and Ecuador,
      are poorly known. Only a proteomic analysis of B. campbelli venom has been
      described. In this work we present a proteomic study of B. myersi venom, its
      biological activities, and describe the clinical characteristics of a patient
      bitten by this species. B. myersi venom mainly consists of phospholipases A2
      (54.0%) and metalloproteinases (21.5%), among proteins of twelve different
      families. This venom exhibited proteolytic, phospholipase A2, myotoxic,
      edema-forming, and lethal activities. Enzymatic activities did not show
      statistically significant differences in comparison to Bothrops asper venom, but 
      B. myersi venom displayed weaker hemorrhagic and coagulant activities. Polyvalent
      Viperidae antivenoms produced in Costa Rica and Colombia cross-recognized B.
      myersi venom by ELISA, however only the latter neutralized its lethal activity in
      mice when tested at a ratio of 3mg venom/mL antivenom, suggesting it should be
      useful to treat envenomings inflicted by this species. A patient bitten by B.
      myersi developed edema and myotoxicity, evidenced by an increased creatine kinase
      activity in plasma. A good correlation was found between experimental biological 
      activities of Bothrocophias myersi venom and the clinical features of an
      envenoming provoked by this species. SIGNIFICANCE: The proteomic
      characterization, toxicity, immunorecognition and neutralization of Bothrocophias
      myersi venom have been determined for the first time. The distribution of this
      pit viper is restricted to Colombia and Ecuador, and its venom contains a high
      proportion of phospholipases A2 and metalloproteinases. The polyvalent antivenom 
      produced in Colombia neutralized the lethal activity of this venom in vivo, and
      therefore should be effective in the treatment of envenomings by this snake.

      Differentiation.
PG  - 139-159
LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-0294-2_11 [doi]
AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a pathogenic protozoan that still has an impact on public
      health, despite the decrease in the number of infection cases along the years. T.
      cruzi possesses an heteroxenic life cycle in which it differentiates in at least 
      four forms. Among the differentiation processes, metacyclogenesis has been
      exploited in different views by researchers. An intriguing question that rises is
      how metacyclogenesis is triggered and controlled by cell signaling and which are 
      the differentially expressed proteins and posttranslational modifications
      involved in this process. An important cell signaling pathway is the protein
      phosphorylation, and it is reinforced in T. cruzi in which the gene expression
      control occurs almost exclusively posttranscriptionally. Additionally, the number
      of protein kinases in T. cruzi is relatively high compared to other organisms. A 
      way to approach these questions is evaluating the cells through phosphoproteomics
      and proteomics. In this chapter, we will describe the steps from the cell protein
      extraction, digestion and fractionation, phosphopeptide enrichment, to LC-MS/MS
      analysis as well as a brief overview on peptide identification. In addition, a
      published method for in vitro metacyclogenesis will be detailed.

TI  - Molecular physiology of chemical defenses in a poison frog.
LID - jeb204149 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.204149 [doi]
AB  - Poison frogs sequester small molecule lipophilic alkaloids from their diet of
      leaf litter arthropods for use as chemical defenses against predation. Although
      the dietary acquisition of chemical defenses in poison frogs is well documented, 
      the physiological mechanisms of alkaloid sequestration has not been investigated.
      Here, we used RNA sequencing and proteomics to determine how alkaloids impact
      mRNA or protein abundance in the little devil frog (Oophaga sylvatica), and
      compared wild-caught chemically defended frogs with laboratory frogs raised on an
      alkaloid-free diet. To understand how poison frogs move alkaloids from their diet
      to their skin granular glands, we focused on measuring gene expression in the
      intestines, skin and liver. Across these tissues, we found many differentially
      expressed transcripts involved in small molecule transport and metabolism, as
      well as sodium channels and other ion pumps. We then used proteomic approaches to
      quantify plasma proteins, where we found several protein abundance differences
      between wild and laboratory frogs, including the amphibian neurotoxin binding
      protein saxiphilin. Finally, because many blood proteins are synthesized in the
      liver, we used thermal proteome profiling as an untargeted screen for soluble
      proteins that bind the alkaloid decahydroquinoline. Using this approach, we
      identified several candidate proteins that interact with this alkaloid, including
      saxiphilin. These transcript and protein abundance patterns suggest that the
      presence of alkaloids influences frog physiology and that small molecule
      transport proteins may be involved in toxin bioaccumulation in dendrobatid poison
      frogs.

AB  - Toxocariasis is a widespread helminth infection of dogs and cats, caused by
      Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati larvae, respectively. Toxocara spp. can cause
      zoonotic infections in humans by invading tissues and organs causing pathology.
      Toxocara spp. larvae release excretory-secretory molecules (TES) into the body of
      their host that are fundamental to the host-parasite interaction and could be
      used as targets for novel diagnostics and vaccines. In the present study, we
      identified 646 T. canis proteins from TES and larval extract using 1D-SDS PAGE
      followed by mass spectrometry. A wide range of proteins was identified that may
      play a role both in the induction of the host immune response and host pathology,
      and in parasite metabolism and survival. Among these proteins there are potential
      candidates for novel diagnostics and vaccines for dogs and cats toxocariases.

AB  - Targeted mass spectrometric methods such as selected/multiple reaction monitoring
      (SRM/MRM) have found intense application in protein detection and quantification 
      which competes with classical immunoaffinity techniques. It provides a universal 
      procedure to develop a fast, highly specific, sensitive, accurate, and cheap
      methodology for targeted detection and quantification of proteins based on the
      direct analysis of their surrogate peptides typically generated by tryptic
      digestion. This methodology can be advantageously applied in the field of plant
      proteomics and particularly for non-model species since immunoreagents are
      scarcely available. Here, we describe the issues to take into consideration in
      order to develop a MRM method to detect and quantify isoforms of the
      thylakoid-bound protein polyphenol oxidase from the non-model and database
      underrepresented species Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.

TI  - A Tau Class Glutathione-S-Transferase is Involved in Trans-Resveratrol Transport 
      Out of Grapevine Cells.
PG  - 1457
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2017.01457 [doi]
AB  - Vitis vinifera cell cultures respond to pathogens and elicitors by synthesizing
      and extracellularly accumulating stilbenoid phytoalexins. Large amounts of
      trans-resveratrol (t-R) are produced when a cell culture is elicited with
      methylated cyclodextrins (MBCD), either alone or combined with methyl jasmonate
      (MeJA). t-R transport to the extracellular medium, which represents the
      apoplastic space, would place this antifungal defense right in the battlefield to
      efficiently fight against pathogen attack. Yet despite their physiological
      relevance, these transport pathways are mostly unknown. A broad hypothesis-free
      DIGE-based proteomic experiment of a temporal series of elicited grapevine cell
      cultures was performed to explore the expression profiles of t-R biosynthetic
      proteins and other co-expressing proteins potentially involved in such a cell
      response. A correlation between two tau class glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs)
      with several stilbene synthase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase isoforms, and with
      the t-R metabolite itself, was found and further assessed by a qRT-PCR gene
      expression analysis. The best candidate, GSTU-2, was cloned from the cDNA of the 
      MBCD + MeJA-elicited grapevine cells and used for Agrobacterium-mediated
      grapevine cell transformation. The non-elicited lines that overexpressed GSTU-2
      displayed an extracellular t-R accumulating phenotype, but stabilization of t-R
      required the addition to culture medium of adsorbent compounds, e.g., PVP or
      beta-cyclodextrin. The wild-type cell cultures accumulated no t-R, not even in
      the presence of adsorbents. The transient expression of the GSTU-2-GFP fusion
      proteins in grapevine cells showed localisation in the plasma membrane, and the
      immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged GSTU-2 revealed its interaction with HIR, a
      plasma membrane-bound protein. These findings are consistent with a functional
      role in transport. This is the first report providing several pieces of
      experimental evidence for the involvement of a specific tau class GST in t-R
      transport to the extracellular medium.

TI  - Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS) Identifies Laurifolioside as a 
      New Clathrin Heavy Chain Modulator.
PG  - 2681-2692
AB  - Five new diterpenes (1-5) and a megastigmane derivative (6) were isolated from
      the aerial parts of Euphorbia laurifolia, along with several known compounds.
      Their structures were elucidated by NMR, MS, and ECD and by chemical methods. A
      chemical proteomics drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) approach to
      investigate the lathyrane diterpene 1, laurifolioside, on its putative cellular
      target(s) was performed. Clathrin heavy chain 1, a protein mainly involved in
      selective uptake of proteins, viruses, and other macromolecules at the plasma
      membrane of cells, was identified as the major interaction partner of compound 1.
      The modulation of clathrin activity by 1 was studied through microscopy,
      molecular docking, and molecular dynamics studies, suggesting a new activity of
      lathyrane diterpenes in the modulation of trafficking pathways.

TI  - The role of proteomics in progressing insights into plant secondary metabolism.
PG  - 504
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2015.00504 [doi]
AB  - The development of omics has enabled the genome-wide exploration of all kinds of 
      biological processes at the molecular level. Almost every field of plant biology 
      has been analyzed at the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic level. Here we
      focus on the particular contribution that proteomic technologies have made in
      progressing knowledge and characterising plant secondary metabolism (SM) pathways
      since early expectations were created 15 years ago. We analyzed how three major
      issues in the proteomic analysis of plant SM have been implemented in various
      research studies. These issues are: (i) the selection of a suitable plant
      material rich in secondary metabolites of interest, such as specialized tissues
      and organs, and in vitro cell cultures; (ii) the proteomic strategy to access
      target proteins, either a comprehensive or a differential analysis; (iii) the
      proteomic approach, represented by the hypothesis-free discovery proteomics and
      the hypothesis-driven targeted proteomics. We also examine to what extent the
      most-advanced technologies have been incorporated into proteomic research in
      plant SM and highlight some cutting edge techniques that would strongly benefit
      the progress made in this field.

TI  - An Appeal to the Global Health Community for a Tripartite Innovation: An
      "Essential Diagnostics List," "Health in All Policies," and "See-Through 21(st)
      Century Science and Ethics".
PG  - 435-42
LID - 10.1089/omi.2015.0075 [doi]
AB  - Diagnostics spanning a wide range of new biotechnologies, including proteomics,
      metabolomics, and nanotechnology, are emerging as companion tests to innovative
      medicines. In this Opinion, we present the rationale for promulgating an
      "Essential Diagnostics List." Additionally, we explain the ways in which adopting
      a vision for "Health in All Policies" could link essential diagnostics with
      robust and timely societal outcomes such as sustainable development, human
      rights, gender parity, and alleviation of poverty. We do so in three ways. First,
      we propose the need for a new, "see through" taxonomy for knowledge-based
      innovation as we transition from the material industries (e.g., textiles,
      plastic, cement, glass) dominant in the 20(th) century to the anticipated
      knowledge industry of the 21st century. If knowledge is the currency of the
      present century, then it is sensible to adopt an approach that thoroughly
      examines scientific knowledge, starting with the production aims, methods,
      quality, distribution, access, and the ends it purports to serve. Second, we
      explain that this knowledge trajectory focus on innovation is crucial and
      applicable across all sectors, including public, private, or public-private
      partnerships, as it underscores the fact that scientific knowledge is a
      co-product of technology, human values, and social systems. By making the value
      systems embedded in scientific design and knowledge co-production transparent, we
      all stand to benefit from sustainable and transparent science. Third, we appeal
      to the global health community to consider the necessary qualities of good
      governance for 21st century organizations that will embark on developing
      essential diagnostics. These have importance not only for science and
      knowledge-based innovation, but also for the ways in which we can build open,
      healthy, and peaceful civil societies today and for future generations.

TI  - Snake venomics of Bothrops punctatus, a semiarboreal pitviper species from
      Antioquia, Colombia.
PG  - e246
LID - 10.7717/peerj.246 [doi]
AB  - Bothrops punctatus is an endangered, semi-arboreal pitviper species distributed
      in Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador, whose venom is poorly characterized. In the
      present work, the protein composition of this venom was profiled using the 'snake
      venomics' analytical strategy. Decomplexation of the crude venom by RP-HPLC and
      SDS-PAGE, followed by tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic digests, showed that it
      consists of proteins assigned to at least nine snake toxin families.
      Metalloproteinases are predominant in this secretion (41.5% of the total
      proteins), followed by C-type lectin/lectin-like proteins (16.7%),
      bradykinin-potentiating peptides (10.7%), phospholipases A2 (93%), serine
      proteinases (5.4%), disintegrins (38%), L-amino acid oxidases (3.1%), vascular
      endothelial growth factors (17%), and cysteine-rich secretory proteins (1.2%).
      Altogether, 6.6% of the proteins were not identified. In vitro, the venom
      exhibited proteolytic, phospholipase A2, and L-amino acid oxidase activities, as 
      well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity, in agreement
      with the obtained proteomic profile. Cytotoxic activity on murine C2C12 myoblasts
      was negative, suggesting that the majority of venom phospholipases A2 likely
      belong to the acidic type, which often lack major toxic effects. The protein
      composition of B. punctatus venom shows a good correlation with toxic activities 
      here and previously reported, and adds further data in support of the wide
      diversity of strategies that have evolved in snake venoms to subdue prey, as
      increasingly being revealed by proteomic analyses.
